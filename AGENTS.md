# 🐦‍⬛ RavenClaws — AI Agent Instructions

This file contains structured instructions for AI coding agents working on the RavenClaws codebase. It defines the project's architecture, conventions, common tasks, and guardrails.

---

## Vision

RavenClaws aims to be the **ultimate AI agentic assistant and worker** — and the **preferred alternative** to the field: Nemoclaw, Hermes Agent, TrustClaw, ZeroClaw, PicoClaw, NanoClaw, Claude Cowork, Manus, Perplexity Computer, Kimi Claw, and Vellum.

We don't aim to win by out-featuring them. We win by refusing to compromise on five pillars at once:

- **Secure** — memory-safe Rust (`unsafe` forbidden), fail-closed, no creds in config, verified supply chain.
- **Small** — one static binary (~5 MB), distroless image, lean dependency tree.
- **Efficient** — native performance, low memory, fast cold start, streaming everywhere.
- **Robust** — graceful degradation, provider fallback, deterministic config, verified across 4 deployment targets.
- **Simple** — one command to run, sensible defaults, no external services required for single-agent use.

---

## Project Overview

RavenClaws is a **lightweight, secure Rust agent framework** with multi-provider LLM support. It runs as a single binary with zero runtime dependencies.

- **Language:** Rust (edition 2021)
- **Version:** 1.0.1 (Simply the Best)
- **License:** AGPL-3.0-or-later + Commercial
- **Repository:** https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws
- **Domain:** https://RavenClaws.io
- **Build:** `cargo build --release` (~5.2 MB stripped binary, ~5 ms startup)
- **Library:** Available as `ravenclaws` on crates.io (binary + library crate)

## Documentation Conventions

### CHANGELOG.md — Tracking Implemented Features & Fixes

All implemented features, resolved issues, and completed changes **must** be documented in `CHANGELOG.md` with the following format:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New feature description (#issue-number)

### Fixed
- Bug fix description (#issue-number)

### Changed
- Modification to existing feature (#issue-number)

### Removed
- Feature or code removal (#issue-number)
```

**When to update:** Every time a PR is merged or a feature branch is completed. Never commit a feature without a corresponding CHANGELOG entry.

### ISSUES.md — Tracking Known Problems

All identified bugs, technical debt, and known limitations **must** be documented in `ISSUES.md` with severity labels:

```markdown
## Critical
- **k8s Deployment enters CrashLoopBackOff** — binary exits after one request, no server mode yet. [No issue]

## High
- **RavenFabric integration not wired** — config struct exists, binary in container, but runtime wiring pending. [No issue]

## Medium
- **22 pre-existing clippy dead_code warnings** — infrastructure types not yet wired to agent loop. [No issue]
```

**Severity levels:**
- **Critical** — Blocks a release or causes incorrect behavior
- **High** — Significant missing functionality or risk
- **Medium** — Important but non-blocking
- **Low** — Nice-to-have improvements

### ROADMAP.md — Tracking Planned Features

All planned features and feature requests **must** be documented as checklists in `ROADMAP.md` with priority labels:

```markdown
### Priority: High
- [ ] **Tool-use (function calling)** — The #1 missing piece. Agent must call tools, not just chat.

### Priority: Medium
- [ ] **Streaming responses** — Real-time token-by-token output for interactive use
```

**Priority levels:**
- **High** — Required for next release or core functionality
- **Medium** — Important but can wait for a later release
- **Low** — Nice-to-have, no fixed timeline

**When a feature is completed:** Move it from ROADMAP.md to CHANGELOG.md under the appropriate `[Unreleased]` section header (`### Added`, `### Fixed`, etc.). Never leave a completed feature in ROADMAP.md — it must be migrated to CHANGELOG.md to keep both documents accurate.

### Test Coverage Mandate

**All critical functionality MUST have automated tests.** Specifically:

- **Every new feature** must include both:
  1. Rust unit tests in the relevant `src/*.rs` module (via `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`)
  2. Shell verification tests in `scripts/lib/` (for integration-level coverage)
- **Every bug fix** must include a test that reproduces the bug and verifies the fix
- **Every config field** must have a test that exercises it
- **Every LLM provider** must have a test in `test-llm-quality.sh`
- **Every deployment target** must have tests in the corresponding `test-*.sh` module

If a feature cannot be tested (e.g., hardware-dependent), document the reason in the test file.

---

## Code Conventions

### Rust Style

- **Formatting:** Standard `rustfmt` (no custom config)
- **Linting:** Standard `clippy`
- **Naming:** Snake_case for functions/variables, CamelCase for types/enums, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- **Error handling:** `thiserror` for library errors, `anyhow` for application-level errors
- **Async:** `tokio` runtime with `async-trait` for provider abstraction
- **Logging:** `tracing` with JSON format — use `info!`, `warn!`, `error!` consistently
- **Unimplemented features:** Use `warn!("...not yet implemented")` + return `Ok(())` — do not panic or exit with error

### Module Responsibilities

2. Create a client struct in `llm.rs` implementing `LLMProviderTrait`
3. Add the client to the `create_client()` factory function
4. Add the provider mapping in `main.rs` CLI override section
5. Add test config in `tests/config/`
6. Add verification tests in `scripts/lib/test-llm-quality.sh`
7. Add CHANGELOG.md entry under "Added"
8. Mark the corresponding ROADMAP.md checklist item as complete

---

## Verification System

The verification suite lives in `scripts/` and is **separate from `cargo test`** (which only has 2 unit tests).

### Structure

```
scripts/
├── verify.sh              — Main orchestrator
└── lib/
    ├── common.sh          — Shared library (colors, paths, logging, test runner)
    ├── test-litellm.sh    — LiteLLM connectivity (4 tests)
    ├── test-local.sh      — macOS binary (12 tests)
    ├── test-docker.sh     — Docker container (10 tests)
    ├── test-linux.sh      — Linux cross-compile (6 tests)
    ├── test-k8s.sh        — Kubernetes (13 tests)
    ├── test-security.sh   — Binary integrity (8 tests)
    ├── test-performance.sh— Benchmarks (5 benchmarks)
    ├── test-llm-quality.sh— LLM response quality (36 tests)
    ├── test-swarm.sh      — Swarm & sub-agent (10 tests)
    └── test-eval.sh       — Eval harness (20 tests)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh --all          # Full suite (114 tests)
./scripts/verify.sh --quick        # Smoke test (litellm + local + swarm + eval + security)
./scripts/verify.sh --litellm      # Single module
./scripts/verify.sh --build        # Build + all tests
```

### Git Hooks (Pre-Commit / Pre-Push)

The project includes git hooks for automated verification before commits and pushes:

```
.githooks/
├── pre-commit    — Fast checks: fmt, clippy, tests, binary size, secrets scan
├── pre-push      — Full checks: pre-commit + release build + Docker + security
└── setup.sh      — Install/check/remove hooks
```

**Install:**
```bash
.githooks/setup.sh          # Configure git to use .githooks
.githooks/setup.sh --check  # Verify hooks are active
.githooks/setup.sh --remove # Restore default hooks
```

**What pre-commit checks:**
1. `cargo fmt --check` — formatting
2. `cargo clippy -D warnings` — linting
3. `cargo test --locked` — unit tests
4. Binary size check — warns if over 5MB
5. Secrets scan — no hardcoded API keys/tokens

**What pre-push additionally checks:**
1. Full pre-commit suite
2. Release build (`cargo build --release`)
3. Binary integrity (architecture, stripped, size)
4. Docker build (if Docker available)
5. Security scan (secrets, setuid, Cargo.lock)

**Skip hooks (emergency only):**
```bash
git commit --no-verify
git push --no-verify
```

### Test Runner Functions

- `run_test "name" command args...` — Runs command, captures output to `target/verification-results/`, logs PASS/FAIL
- `run_test_verbose "name" command args...` — Same but shows full output on failure
- `check_llm_response_quality log_file model_name` — Checks that LLM response is non-empty

### Common Pitfalls

- **Test names with `/`** — Creates subdirectories in results. Use spaces or hyphens instead.
- **`bash -c` quoting** — Use escaped double quotes `\"` inside `bash -c` strings. Avoid nested single quotes.
- **macOS `file` command** — Doesn't say "stripped" for stripped binaries. Check for "Mach-O" instead.
- **Distroless containers** — No shell, no `cat`, no `id`. Use `docker image inspect` for user checks.
- **K8s `runAsNonRoot`** — Requires numeric UID. Use `runAsUser: 65532` instead.
- **ConfigMap jsonpath** — Keys with dots (e.g., `ravenclaws.toml`) are unreliable. Use `go-template='{{index .data "key"}}'`.

## Deployment Targets

| Target | Binary Location | How to Build |
|---|---|---|
| macOS (aarch64) | `target/release/ravenclaws` | `cargo build --release` |
| macOS (x86_64) | `target/x86_64-apple-darwin/release/ravenclaws` | `cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin` |
| Linux ARM64 | `target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/ravenclaws` | Cross-compile or Docker build |
| Linux x86_64 | `target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/ravenclaws` | Cross-compile or Docker build |
| Docker | `ghcr.io/egkristi/ravenclaws:latest` | `docker build -t ravenclaws:latest .` |
| Kubernetes | `k8s/deployment.yaml` | `kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml` |

### Docker

- Multi-stage build: `rust:1.86-slim-bookworm` → `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian12:nonroot`
- User: `nonroot` (UID 65532)
- No shell, no package manager, minimal attack surface
- HEALTHCHECK runs `--version`

### Kubernetes

- Production: `k8s/deployment.yaml` — in-cluster LiteLLM, full RBAC, Secrets
- Testing: `k8s/deployment-test.yaml` — hostNetwork for local LiteLLM, no Secrets

---

## Common Tasks

### Fixing `--exec` Mode

The `--exec` CLI flag is parsed in `main.rs` but never used. To fix:
1. In `main.rs`, after config loading, check `if let Some(prompt) = args.exec`
2. Pass the prompt as the user message content instead of the hardcoded "Ready. Awaiting instructions."
3. The agent should send the exec prompt and print the response to stdout (not just log it)

### Adding a New Test Module

1. Create `scripts/lib/test-myfeature.sh` with a function `test_myfeature()`
2. Source `common.sh` at the top
3. Add to `MODULES` array in `scripts/verify.sh`: `"myfeature:test-myfeature.sh:test_myfeature:My Feature Description"`
4. Use `run_test` and `check_llm_response_quality` from common.sh

### Adding a New Config Field

1. Add field to the appropriate struct in `config.rs`
2. Add a `#[serde(default = "default_fn")]` attribute with a default function
3. Add validation in `Config::validate()` if needed
4. Add env var mapping in `Config::load()` if needed
5. Update test configs in `tests/config/`

---

## Maintenance Cycle Workflow

This is the **standard operating procedure** for every maintenance cycle. Follow these steps in order, every time.

### Phase 1: Check CI Status

```bash
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/egkristi/RavenClaws/actions/runs?per_page=6&branch=master&event=push" | python3 -c "
import json,sys
data=json.load(sys.stdin)
for r in data.get('workflow_runs',[])[:6]:
    print(f\"#{r['run_number']:5d}  {r['name'][:25]:25s}  {r['status']:15s}  {str(r['conclusion']):10s}  {r['head_commit']['message'][:60] if r.get('head_commit') else '---'}\")"
```

- Check all 3 workflows: **Build & Release**, **Container Build**, **Security Scan**
- If any are **in_progress**, wait for them to complete
- If any **failed**, investigate and fix before proceeding
- If all green, proceed to Phase 2

### Phase 2: Fix Issues

1. **ISSUES.md** — Read the file, address each issue by severity (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
2. **VS Code Problems Tab** — Open the problems tab (`Cmd+Shift+M`), fix all errors/warnings
3. **ROADMAP.md** — Read the file, pick the next uncompleted feature and implement it

### Phase 3: Verify Locally on Orbstack

Run the full verification suite against all deployment targets available on Orbstack:

```bash
# 1. Local binary (macOS)
./scripts/verify.sh --local

# 2. Docker container (Orbstack Docker)
./scripts/verify.sh --docker

# 3. Kubernetes (Orbstack K8s)
./scripts/verify.sh --k8s

# 4. Linux VM (Orbstack cross-compile)
./scripts/verify.sh --linux

# 5. Full suite (all of the above + security + performance + LLM quality)
./scripts/verify.sh --all
```

- If any tests **fail**, fix the issue and re-run
- If any issues arise, **register them in ISSUES.md** with appropriate severity

### Phase 4: Update Documentation

When a feature is finished or a fix is complete, update **all** relevant documents:

| Document | When to update |
|---|---|
| `ROADMAP.md` | Feature completed → move from ROADMAP to CHANGELOG. CI status updated. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Every feature, fix, or change → add under `[Unreleased]` |
| `README.md` | User-facing features or config changes |
| `ISSUES.md` | New bugs discovered, issues resolved, CI status updated |
| `docs/guides/verification.md` | Tests added, changed, or removed |
| `AGENTS.md` | Workflow changes, new conventions, architecture changes |
| `docs/guides/website.md` | Deployment workflow changes, new website features |
| `website/public/index.html` | New features, providers, stats changes, comparison updates |
| `website/public/docs/*.html` | When corresponding `docs/guides/*.md` is updated |
| `website/public/_headers` | Security policy changes, new third-party embeds |
| `website/public/_redirects` | New external resources needing shortlinks |
| `website/public/sitemap.xml` | Pages added or removed |

### Phase 5: Commit & Push

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Pre-commit hooks run automatically (fmt, clippy, 416 tests, binary size, secrets)
git commit -m "Descriptive summary of changes"

# Pre-push hooks run automatically (pre-commit + release build + Docker + security)
git push
```

- If pre-commit hooks **fail**, fix and re-commit
- If pre-push hooks **fail**, fix and re-push

### Phase 6: Verify CI After Push

After pushing, **monitor all 3 GitHub Actions workflows to completion**:

1. **Build & Release** — Check that all 5 build targets succeed
2. **Container Build** — Check multi-arch images build and push
3. **Security Scan** — Check CodeQL, cargo-audit, cargo-deny, etc.

```bash
# Poll until all complete
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/egkristi/RavenClaws/actions/runs?per_page=6&branch=master&event=push" | python3 -c "
import json,sys
data=json.load(sys.stdin)
for r in data.get('workflow_runs',[])[:6]:
    print(f\"#{r['run_number']:5d}  {r['name'][:25]:25s}  {r['status']:15s}  {str(r['conclusion']):10s}  {r['head_commit']['message'][:60] if r.get('head_commit') else '---'}\")"
```

- If any pipeline **fails**, investigate, fix, and re-push
- If any issues arise, **register them in ISSUES.md**

### Phase 7: Release (mandatory for all versions)

**Every completed version MUST be released.** No exceptions. Whether it's a minor version with new features or a patch version with bug fixes — if it's merged to master, it ships. A release includes:
- Version bump in `Cargo.toml`
- Changelog section for the new version
- Signed git tag
- GitHub Release with binary assets
- Container images pushed to GHCR and Docker Hub
- crates.io publication

## Guardrails

### Do NOT

- **Do not** add Python, Node.js, or other runtime dependencies — the binary must be self-contained
- **Do not** hardcode API keys, tokens, or credentials anywhere in the codebase
- **Do not** remove the `strip = true` or `panic = "abort"` from release profile
- **Do not** use `unsafe` code unless absolutely necessary and documented
- **Do not** add large dependencies (>100KB) without evaluating alternatives
- **Do not** change the distroless base image without security review
- **Do not** remove the `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` or `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]` from K8s manifests
- **Do not** make swarm/supervisor modes exit with error — keep the stub pattern until implemented

### Do

- **Do** use `tracing` for all logging (not `println!` or `eprintln!`)
- **Do** add tests for every new feature (both Rust unit tests and shell verification tests)
- **Do** update CHANGELOG.md for every implemented feature, fix, or change
- **Do** update ISSUES.md when discovering new bugs or limitations
- **Do** update ROADMAP.md when starting or completing roadmap items
- **Do** update `docs/guides/verification.md` when adding or changing verification tests
- **Do** update README.md when adding user-facing features
- **Do** keep the binary under 5MB — if it grows, investigate alternatives
- **Do** run `.githooks/setup.sh` after cloning the repo to enable pre-commit/pre-push hooks
- **Do** update `.githooks/` when adding new verification checks that should run before commits
- **Do** use env vars for all secrets — never config files

---

## Release Process

**Policy: Every completed version MUST be released.** No exceptions. Whether it's a minor version with new features or a patch version with bug fixes — if it's merged to master, it ships.

When all TODOs and features for a version milestone are completed, GitHub Actions for the final commit are green, all tests pass, test coverage is good, and everything else is ready — follow this release process.

### Phase 1: Pre-Release Checks

Before bumping the version, verify everything is clean:

```bash
# 1. Full Rust test suite — all 149+ tests must pass
cargo test --locked 2>&1

# 2. Clippy must be clean (no warnings, no errors)
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings 2>&1

# 3. Formatting must be clean
cargo fmt --check 2>&1

# 4. Full verification suite (build + all test modules)
./scripts/verify.sh --build 2>&1

# 5. Check test coverage is adequate (no untested critical paths)
#    - Every config field has a test
#    - Every LLM provider has a test
#    - Every error variant has a test
#    - Every CLI argument has a test
#    - Every deployment target has verification tests
```

If any of these fail, **do not proceed** — fix the issue first.

### Phase 2: Version Bump

Update the version in `Cargo.toml`:

```bash
# For a patch release (bug fixes only):
sed -i '' 's/^version = "0\.1\.0"/version = "0.1.1"/' Cargo.toml

# For a minor release (new features, backward-compatible):
sed -i '' 's/^version = "0\.1\.0"/version = "0.2.0"/' Cargo.toml

# For a major release (breaking changes):
sed -i '' 's/^version = "0\.1\.0"/version = "1.0.0"/' Cargo.toml
```

Update the version reference in `AGENTS.md` itself (Project Overview section) and any other docs that reference the version.

### Phase 2b: Update Website

Update the website to reflect the new version before committing:

```bash
# 1. Update version number in landing page JSON-LD
sed -i '' 's/"softwareVersion": "0\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*"/"softwareVersion": "vX.Y.Z"/' website/public/index.html

# 2. Update stats on the landing page (hero section)
#    - Binary size (~5.2 MB) — update if changed
#    - Unit test count — update if tests were added/removed
#    - Module count — update if modules were added/removed
#    - LLM provider count — update if providers were added/removed
#    Search for stat numbers in website/public/index.html and update them

# 3. Update feature descriptions if new capabilities were added
#    Check if any new features need to be reflected in the landing page

# 4. Preview locally
cd website && npm run dev

# 5. Deploy to production
cd website && npm run deploy
```

**When to skip:** If the release has no user-facing changes (e.g., internal refactoring only), the website deploy can be deferred. But version number and stats should still be updated.

### Phase 3: Update Changelog

Move all `[Unreleased]` entries into a new `[vX.Y.Z]` section:

```markdown
## [v0.1.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- (all added features from Unreleased)

### Fixed
- (all fixes from Unreleased)

### Changed
- (all changes from Unreleased)
```

Then clear the `[Unreleased]` section headers (keep the structure, remove old entries).

### Phase 4: Commit & Tag

> **Important:** The website must be deployed BEFORE committing, so the release tag
> points to a state where the website already reflects the new version.

```bash
# 0. Deploy website first (reflects new version on ravenclaws.io)
cd website && npm run deploy && cd ..

# Commit the version bump, changelog update, and website changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Release v0.1.0"

# Tag the release (signed tag preferred)
git tag -s v0.1.0 -m "RavenClaws v0.1.0"

# Push everything (triggers CI/CD pipelines)
git push --follow-tags
```

Pushing the tag triggers the following GitHub Actions workflows:

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `build.yml` | Tag push `v*` | `check` (fmt+clippy+test) → `build-binaries` (5 targets) → `containers` (multi-arch, multi-registry, sign, SBOM, Trivy) → `publish-cratesio` → `release` (GitHub Release with assets) |
| `container.yml` | Tag push `v*` | Builds + pushes multi-arch containers, signs with Cosign, generates attestation, Trivy scan, SBOM |
| `security-scan.yml` | Tag push `v*` | CodeQL, cargo-audit, cargo-deny, cargo-outdated, cargo-udeps, OSSF Scorecard |

### Phase 5: Monitor CI/CD

After pushing the tag, **monitor all GitHub Actions workflows to completion**:

1. Go to https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws/actions
2. Verify the `check` job passes (fmt + clippy + test)
3. Verify all 5 `build-binaries` matrix jobs succeed:
   - `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
   - `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
   - `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
   - `x86_64-apple-darwin`
   - `aarch64-apple-darwin`
4. Verify `containers` job builds and pushes multi-arch images to both GHCR and Docker Hub
5. Verify Cosign signing completes
6. Verify artifact attestation is generated
7. Verify Trivy vulnerability scan passes (exit code 0)
8. Verify SBOM is generated and uploaded
9. Verify `publish-cratesio` publishes to crates.io
10. Verify `release` job creates the GitHub Release with all binary assets attached

If **any job fails**, investigate and fix before proceeding. Do not create a new tag until the issue is resolved.

### Phase 6: Post-Release Binary & Container Verification

After all CI/CD pipelines pass, run a full battery of tests against the **newly released** binaries and container images:

```bash
# ── 6a. Pull and verify the released container image ──────────
docker pull ghcr.io/egkristi/ravenclaws:v0.1.0
docker run --rm ghcr.io/egkristi/ravenclaws:v0.1.0 --version

# ── 6b. Run full verification suite against the release ───────
# (This tests local binary, Docker container, K8s manifests, etc.)
./scripts/verify.sh --build

# ── 6c. Verify binary integrity ───────────────────────────────
# Download a released binary and check its SHA256
# (Replace URL with actual release asset URL)
curl -sL https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws/releases/download/v0.1.0/ravenclaws-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz \
  -o /tmp/ravenclaws-release.tar.gz
tar xzf /tmp/ravenclaws-release.tar.gz -C /tmp/
./scripts/verify.sh --security

# ── 6d. Verify container security properties ──────────────────
docker image inspect ghcr.io/egkristi/ravenclaws:v0.1.0 --format '{{.Config.User}}'
# Must output "65532" (nonroot user)

# ── 6e. Verify multi-arch support ─────────────────────────────
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/egkristi/ravenclaws:v0.1.0
# Must show both linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 manifests

# ── 6f. Verify container signature ────────────────────────────
cosign verify ghcr.io/egkristi/ravenclaws:v0.1.0 \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"

# ── 6g. Verify SBOM exists ────────────────────────────────────
# Download SBOM from GitHub Release assets or regenerate:
syft ghcr.io/egkristi/ravenclaws:v0.1.0 -o spdx-json=sbom-verify.spdx.json
```

### Phase 7: Final Validation

```bash
# ── 7a. Verify crates.io package ──────────────────────────────
cargo search ravenclaws
# Should show the new version

# ── 7b. Verify GitHub Release ─────────────────────────────────
# Check https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws/releases
# Must have:
#   - Release notes (auto-generated from changelog)
#   - 5 binary archives (.tar.gz/.zip) with SHA256 checksums
#   - SBOM artifact
#   - Container image signatures

# ── 7c. Verify the binary works end-to-end ────────────────────
/tmp/ravenclaws --version
/tmp/ravenclaws --help
echo "Hello" | /tmp/ravenclaws --exec "Say hello back" 2>&1 || true

# ── 7d. Verify website reflects the new version ───────────────
curl -s https://ravenclaws.io | grep -o '"softwareVersion": "[^"]*"'
# Should show the new version number

# ── 7e. Verify website docs are up to date ────────────────────
# Check that any new docs pages or updated guides are live
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' https://ravenclaws.io/docs/getting-started
# Should return 200
```

### Release Abort Criteria

If any of the following occur during the release process, **abort immediately** and do not create/push a tag:

1. Any Rust test fails (`cargo test --locked`)
2. Clippy or fmt check fails
3. Any verification suite module fails (`./scripts/verify.sh --all`)
4. Any CI job in the build workflow fails
5. Trivy scan finds CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerabilities (exit code 1)
6. Cosign signing fails
7. Container image does not run as nonroot user (UID 65532)
8. Multi-arch manifest is missing either linux/amd64 or linux/arm64
9. Binary SHA256 checksums do not match after download
10. GitHub Release is missing required assets
11. **Website deploy fails** — `npm run deploy` exits with non-zero status
12. **Website version mismatch** — `ravenclaws.io` shows old version after deploy

**If aborting:** Delete the tag locally and remotely, fix the issue, then restart from Phase 1:

```bash
git tag -d v0.1.0
git push --delete origin v0.1.0
```

## Website (ravenclaws.io)

The project website lives in `website/` and is a **self-contained static site** deployed to
**Cloudflare Workers Static Assets** via **Wrangler**. There is no build step, no bundler,
and no framework — everything the browser needs is hand-authored HTML, CSS, and JS in
`website/public/`. This mirrors RavenClaws itself: small, simple, zero dependencies.

### Architecture

```
website/
├── public/                 # ← everything served at ravenclaws.io
│   ├── index.html          # landing page (hero, features, comparison, security, license)
│   ├── 404.html            # custom 404 page
│   ├── docs/               # documentation hub (mirrors docs/guides/ in the repo)
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── getting-started.html
│   │   ├── configuration.html
│   │   ├── swarm-mode.html
│   │   ├── mcp-integration.html
│   │   └── heartbeat-mode.html
│   ├── assets/             # styles.css, main.js, raven-*.webp, favicons, og-image.png
│   ├── _headers            # security + cache headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
│   ├── _redirects          # shortlinks (/github → GitHub, /crate → crates.io, etc.)
│   ├── robots.txt
│   ├── sitemap.xml
│   └── site.webmanifest    # PWA manifest
├── wrangler.jsonc          # Cloudflare deploy config (name, routes, assets dir)
├── package.json            # wrangler dev-dependency + scripts
└── DEPLOY.md               # full deployment walkthrough (also in docs/guides/website.md)
```

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **No build step** | Static HTML/CSS/JS — zero toolchain, instant deploy, no lock-in |
| **Workers Static Assets** | Cloudflare's recommended approach (not Pages, not Workers Sites) |
| **Single stylesheet** | `styles.css` used by every page — one theme, no duplication |
| **Docs mirror repo guides** | `public/docs/*.html` mirrors `docs/guides/*.md` — keep in sync manually |
| **No analytics** | Consistent with project's "no telemetry, ever" stance |
| **No GitHub Actions** | Website deploys manually via `npm run deploy` — not part of CI/CD |

### Deployment

The website is **not** deployed via GitHub Actions. It's deployed manually from a
developer's machine using Wrangler:

```bash
cd website
npm install              # one-time: install wrangler
npx wrangler login       # one-time: authenticate with Cloudflare
npm run deploy           # = wrangler deploy — uploads public/ to Cloudflare edge
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Cloudflare account (free tier)
- Node.js 18+
- `ravenclaws.io` zone added to Cloudflare account

**Custom domain:** Already configured in `wrangler.jsonc` via the `routes` block.
On first deploy, Cloudflare provisions DNS records + TLS certificate automatically.

**Local preview:**
```bash
npm run dev       # Cloudflare-accurate preview (honours _headers/_redirects)
npm run preview   # plain static server (no Cloudflare features)
```

### Content Management

#### Updating the Landing Page

Edit `website/public/index.html`. The page has these sections:
- **Hero** — tagline, stats, CTA buttons
- **Trust strip** — security badges (memory-safe, Cosign-signed, no telemetry, etc.)
- **Pillars** — the five pillars (Secure, Small, Efficient, Robust, Simple)
- **Features** — capability cards (agent loop, tools & MCP, multi-provider, swarm, etc.)
- **Quickstart** — code blocks (install, library, Docker, Helm, serve/REPL)
- **Providers** — the five supported LLM providers
- **Comparison table** — RavenClaws vs cloud assistants vs minimal runtimes
- **Security** — PolicyEngine, Sandbox, Audit log, no phone-home
- **License** — AGPLv3 + Commercial dual-license

**When to update:** When a new feature ships, a provider is added, stats change
(test count, binary size, module count), or the comparison table needs updating.

#### Updating Documentation Pages

Each page in `website/public/docs/` mirrors a guide in `docs/guides/`:

| Website page | Source guide |
|---|---|
| `public/docs/getting-started.html` | `docs/guides/getting-started.md` |
| `public/docs/configuration.html` | `docs/guides/configuration.md` |
| `public/docs/swarm-mode.html` | `docs/guides/swarm-mode.md` |
| `public/docs/mcp-integration.html` | `docs/guides/mcp-integration.md` |
| `public/docs/heartbeat-mode.html` | `docs/guides/heartbeat-mode.md` |

**When to update:** Whenever a guide in `docs/guides/` is updated, the corresponding
HTML page in `public/docs/` must be updated to match. This is a manual sync — there
is no automated conversion from Markdown to HTML.

**How to update a docs page:**
1. Read the source guide from `docs/guides/`
2. Read the corresponding HTML page from `website/public/docs/`
3. Update the HTML to reflect the guide changes, keeping the same header/footer/nav
4. Preview locally with `npm run dev`
5. Deploy with `npm run deploy`

#### Updating Assets

- **Styles:** `website/public/assets/styles.css` — single theme, dark technical with raven-cyan accents
- **JavaScript:** `website/public/assets/main.js` — small progressive-enhancement script (scroll shadow, mobile nav toggle, copy buttons, scroll-spy)
- **Art:** `website/public/assets/raven-*.webp` — raven artwork in WebP format
- **Favicons:** Multiple sizes in `public/assets/` — update all when changing the logo
- **OG image:** `website/public/assets/og-image.png` (1200×630) — update when branding changes

**Image optimization guidelines:**
- Use WebP format for all artwork (smaller than PNG, better quality than JPEG)
- Keep file sizes under 200KB for hero images, under 50KB for decorative
- Source artwork is in `~/Downloads/RavenClaws/` (backgrounds removed, resized, optimized)

#### Updating Shortlinks

Edit `website/public/_redirects`:

```
/github      https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws            302
/crate       https://crates.io/crates/ravenclaws               302
/api         https://docs.rs/ravenclaws                        302
/releases    https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws/releases   302
/discuss     https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws/discussions 302
```

**When to update:** When adding a new external resource that deserves a shortlink.

#### Updating Security Headers

Edit `website/public/_headers`. Current policy includes:
- HSTS (2 years, includeSubDomains, preload)
- CSP (self-only for scripts/fonts/connections, self+data+https for images)
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy` (no geolocation, microphone, or camera)
- Long-lived cache for `/assets/*` (1 year, immutable)

**When to update:** When adding third-party embeds (adjust CSP), or when security
best practices evolve.

#### Updating Sitemap

Edit `website/public/sitemap.xml`. Currently includes 7 URLs (home + 6 docs pages).
**When to update:** When adding or removing pages.

### Common Tasks

#### Adding a New Docs Page

1. Create `website/public/docs/new-feature.html` — copy an existing docs page as template
2. Add the page to the sidebar nav in all docs pages (`<aside class="docs-side">`)
3. Add the URL to `website/public/sitemap.xml`
4. Preview locally with `npm run dev`
5. Deploy with `npm run deploy`

#### Updating the Version Number

The version number appears in:
1. `website/public/index.html` — in the `<script type="application/ld+json">` block (`"softwareVersion": "0.9.2"`)
2. `website/public/index.html` — hero stats (452 tests, 18 modules — update if these change)

**When to update:** On every release.

#### Updating Stats on the Landing Page

The hero section shows key stats:
- Binary size (~5.2 MB)
- Runtime deps (0)
- LLM providers (5)
- Unit tests (452)
- Modules (18)

**When to update:** When any of these numbers change (e.g., new module added, test count changes).

### Guardrails

#### Do NOT

- **Do not** add a build step, bundler, or framework (no React, no Astro, no Hugo, no Jekyll)
- **Do not** add analytics, tracking pixels, or phone-home of any kind
- **Do not** add third-party JavaScript (no CDN scripts, no embeds that require JS)
- **Do not** commit API keys, tokens, or secrets in `wrangler.jsonc` or any website file
- **Do not** add the website deploy to GitHub Actions — it's intentionally manual
- **Do not** use relative paths in `_headers` or `_redirects` — Cloudflare requires absolute paths
- **Do not** remove the CSP or weaken security headers without security review

#### Do

- **Do** keep the website in sync with the repo — when you update a guide in `docs/guides/`, update the matching page in `website/public/docs/`
- **Do** preview locally with `npm run dev` before deploying
- **Do** update `sitemap.xml` when adding or removing pages
- **Do** update `site.webmanifest` when adding new icon sizes
- **Do** use WebP for all artwork images
- **Do** keep the website deploy documented in `docs/guides/website.md` and `website/DEPLOY.md`
- **Do** update the version number and stats on the landing page during release

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Local preview (Cloudflare-accurate)
cd website && npm run dev

# Deploy to production
cd website && npm run deploy

# First-time setup
cd website && npm install && npx wrangler login
```
