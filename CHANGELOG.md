## [v1.1.0] — 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Multi-modal input support** — New `ContentPart` enum (`Text`, `ImageUrl`) enables attaching images alongside text in chat messages. Added `load_image()` utility that reads image files (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP) and produces data URIs. New `--image` / `-I` CLI flag accepts image file paths. Multi-modal serialization for all 5 providers: OpenAI-compatible APIs use `[{type, image_url, image_url: {url}}]`, Anthropic uses `[{type, image, source: {type, media_type, data}}]`, Ollama uses `images: [base64, ...]` array on messages. Agent loop integration via `run_agent_loop_with_images()` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp_and_images()`. `ConversationMemory::add_user_message_with_images()` for persistent multi-turn conversations with images. Library exports include `ContentPart`, `ImageUrlContent`, `load_image`. 478 unit tests pass, clippy clean.
- **Browser automation tool** — New `BrowserTool` built-in tool that controls a browser via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). Supports 10 actions: `navigate` (go to URL), `click` (click element by CSS selector), `type` (type text into element), `screenshot` (capture page content), `extract` (extract text from element), `get_html` (get page/element HTML), `get_text` (get visible page text), `scroll` (scroll down/up/to_bottom/to_top), `wait` (pause execution), `evaluate` (run JavaScript). Connects to Chrome/Chromium running with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`. New `BrowserConfig` struct in `config.rs` with `cdp_url` and `request_timeout` fields. New `ToolCategory::Browser` variant. Registered in all 3 registry methods (`with_default_tools`, `with_web_search_config`, `with_config`). 15 unit tests covering definition, config, registry, argument validation, and action dispatch. 500 unit tests pass, clippy clean.
- **Graceful degradation under load** — New `src/load.rs` module with `LoadManager`, `TokenBucket` rate limiter, `ErrorTracker` sliding window, and `LoadConfig` configuration. Combines rate limiting, concurrency control (semaphore-based), and load shedding (queue depth + error rate thresholds) into a single admission control API. Wired to HTTP server (`ServerState.load_manager`) — admission checks in `handle_connection` return 429/503 on overload. Wired to agent loop (`AgentLoopConfig.load_manager`) — admission checks before LLM calls with outcome recording. Load metrics exposed via `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus format. New `LoadConfig` struct in `config.rs` with 7 configurable fields. 12 unit tests covering token bucket, error tracker, admission control, metrics, and Prometheus formatting. 507 unit tests pass, clippy clean.

## [v1.0.1] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **WASM plugin system** — New `src/plugins.rs` module with `WasmPlugin`, `WasmPluginManager`, and `PluginTool` types. Load `.wasm` binaries at runtime via Plugin ABI v1 (7 required exports). Supports tool enumeration, execution, and registration into `ToolRegistry`. 11 unit tests covering load, tools, execute, manager, unload, version mismatch, and missing export scenarios. Uses `wasmtime` 28 with `cranelift` and `runtime` features. (rpi5-feedback)

### Fixed
- **`/execute` returns empty result without `no_final_required`** — Changed `no_final_required` default from `false` to `true` in `background.rs` task execution config. The `/execute` endpoint now correctly returns the agent's response even when the model doesn't emit a `FINAL:` marker, matching the behavior of the `/chat` endpoint. (#39, rpi5-feedback)
- **RavenFabric health check URL builder error with WebSocket endpoints** — Added `http_url()` helper method in `ravenfabric.rs` that converts `ws://` to `http://` and `wss://` to `https://` for REST API calls. Applied to `health()`, `list_agents()`, and `execute()` methods. (#42, rpi5-feedback)
- **`GET /tools/{name}` returns 404 instead of falling through to catch-all** — Added dedicated `GET /tools/{name}` route handler (`handle_get_tool`) that returns tool details by name. Also improved error status mapping in `POST /tools/{name}` to return 404 (not 400) when a tool is not found. (rpi5-feedback)

### Added
- **`POST /reload` endpoint for distroless-friendly config reload** — New `/reload` HTTP endpoint provides the same config reload functionality as SIGHUP but works in distroless containers that lack a shell or `kill` binary. Accepts `POST` requests and reloads configuration from the original config path. (rpi5-feedback)
- **`--no-final-required` is now the default** — Changed `AgentLoopConfig::default()` to set `no_final_required: true`. The agent loop now treats any non-tool-call response as completion without requiring a `FINAL:` marker. Added `--require-final` CLI flag (and `RAVENCLAWS_REQUIRE_FINAL` env var) for users who want the old behavior. This is the #1 usability fix — most models don't emit `FINAL:`. (rpi5-feedback)
- **`Dockerfile.slim` — Debian-based alternative for MCP client support** — New `Dockerfile.slim` using `debian:stable-slim` as the runtime base image. Includes `nodejs` and `npm` for MCP client connections (via `npx`), `curl` for HTTP endpoint testing, and a shell for debugging. Runs as non-root user (UID 65532). Build with `docker buildx build -f Dockerfile.slim ...`. (rpi5-feedback)
- **SQLite conversation persistence** — New `src/persistence.rs` module with `ConversationStore` for SQLite-backed conversation history. Supports session CRUD, message storage with token counts, and configurable retention policies (time-based, count-based, token-budget-based, unlimited). `import_memory()` bridges `ConversationMemory` to SQLite. 15 unit tests. (rpi5-feedback)

## [0.9.6] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Full Agent Execution API (6 new endpoints)** — `server.rs` now exposes `POST /chat` (chat completion), `POST /execute` (async task execution with tools), `GET /tasks/{id}` (poll task status), `GET /tools` (list registered tools), `POST /tools/{name}` (execute a specific tool), and `GET /health/deep` (detailed health with uptime, request count, LLM provider, tools registered). All endpoints return structured JSON responses.
- **SIGHUP configuration reload** — `server.rs` now listens for `SIGHUP` on Unix systems. On receipt, re-reads the config file and logs the result. Full hot-reload of LLM clients and tool registries deferred to v0.9.8.
- **MCP TOML configuration section** — New `[mcp]` config section with `[[mcp.servers]]` array for declaring MCP server processes. Each server has `name`, `command`, `args`, and `env` fields. Config structs `McpConfig` and `McpServerConfig` added to `config.rs` and re-exported from `lib.rs`.
- **Swarm profiles shorthand syntax** — `[swarm.profiles]` now accepts both the standard `[[swarm.profiles]]` array-of-tables and a compact map shorthand (`name = "persona"`). Custom `deserialize_profiles` deserializer handles both formats transparently.
- **Tool call assertions for eval harness** — Two new assertion variants: `tool_called("name")` and `tool_not_called("name")`. These check the run trace's tool call list rather than the response text. `check_assertions()` now accepts an optional `&RunTrace` parameter. Includes 5 unit tests covering pass/fail for both variants and the no-trace edge case.
- **Server mode documentation** — New `docs/guides/server-mode.md` guide and `website/public/docs/server-mode.html` page covering all 9 endpoints, configuration, Docker/K8s/systemd deployment, SIGHUP reload, graceful shutdown, and cURL/Python/Node.js examples. Added to sitemap, docs index, sidebar nav, and footer.
- **`ToolRegistry` now implements `Clone`** — Added `#[derive(Clone)]` to `ToolRegistry` so it can be shared across threads (e.g., cloned into `ServerState`).

### Fixed
- **Config test initializers** — All 17 `Config` struct initializations in test code updated to include the new `mcp` field.
- **Eval test calls updated** — All `check_single_assertion` test calls updated to pass the new `Option<&RunTrace>` parameter.

## [v0.9.7] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Multi-MCP-client support** — New `McpClientManager` struct in `mcp.rs` that holds multiple `McpClient` instances. `from_config()` creates clients from TOML config `[mcp]` section. `register_all_tools()` registers tools from all connected servers into a `ToolRegistry`. Wired into both `--exec` mode and `--serve` (HTTP server) mode. `#[allow(dead_code)]` removed from `McpConfig` and `McpServerConfig`. Re-exported from `lib.rs`.
- **Readiness LLM connectivity check** — `ready_response()` in `server.rs` now optionally verifies LLM connectivity before returning 200. When an LLM client is configured, sends a lightweight probe and returns `503 Service Unavailable` with descriptive message if the LLM is unreachable or times out (5s timeout). Falls back to simple boolean check when no LLM is configured.

## [v0.9.9] — 2026-06-28

### Added
- **ProviderFallbackChain wired into agent loop** — Both `run_agent_loop_with_registry` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp_and_registry` now use `ProviderFallbackChain` on primary LLM failure. Configs are cloned out of mutex to avoid holding `MutexGuard` across `.await`. Token usage recorded from fallback responses.
- **TokenBudget wired into agent loop** — Checked before every LLM call in both agent loop variants. If remaining tokens < 100, returns `SecurityViolation` error with audit log entry. Token usage recorded after each response.
- **RavenFabricClient wired into agent loop** — `health()` called after each LLM response in both agent loop variants. Wired into all `run_single`, `run_swarm`, `run_supervisor` variants (both single and multi-model).
- **AgentMessageBus wired into swarm** — Created and shared across sub-orchestrators. `send()` and `format_for_prompt()` used in swarm execution.
- **SwarmHealthMonitor wired into swarm** — `check_health()` called during swarm execution. Dead agents detected and logged.

### Changed
- **`#[allow(dead_code)]` removed from wired components** — `TokenBudget` struct + impl, `TokenBudgetExceeded` variant, `RavenFabricClient` struct + impl, `ExecuteResponse`, `RemoteAgent`, `RavenFabricConfig` fields (`agent_id`, `remote_exec`), `RavenClawsError::RavenFabric` variant. `ProviderFallbackChain` gets `#[derive(Debug)]` and `pub configs` field.
- **`AgentLoopConfig` extended** — 3 new optional fields: `fallback_chain`, `token_budget`, `ravenfabric`. All initializers across `agent.rs`, `background.rs`, `server.rs`, `heartbeat.rs`, and `examples/agent_loop.rs` updated.
- **`main.rs` updated** — RavenFabricClient init moved before `--exec` block. Fallback chain and token budget created from config in `--exec` mode.
- **ROADMAP.md updated** — v0.9.8 exit criteria corrected: 5/5 infra components wired ✅, 7 production hardening items deferred to v0.9.9. v0.9.9 scope expanded to include Tier 4 (production hardening). Strategic positioning refined.

### Fixed
- **Default workdir changed from `/workspace` to `/tmp/ravenclaws-workdir`** — The previous default `/workspace` caused `Permission denied (os error 13)` on distroless containers without an explicit volume mount. The new default uses `/tmp` which is writable on distroless. K8s deployments that explicitly set `workdir = "/workspace"` with an `emptyDir` volume are unaffected. (#rpi5-feedback)

### Removed
*(none)*

## [v1.0.0] — 2026-07-02

### Added
- **`--mcp-sse-server` CLI flag** — New `--mcp-sse-server` flag (env: `RAVENCLAWS_MCP_SSE_SERVER`) runs RavenClaws as an MCP SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport server. Supports `--mcp-sse-host` (default `0.0.0.0`) and `--mcp-sse-port` (default `8081`) flags. Wired into `main.rs` dispatch with graceful shutdown via `ShutdownFlag`. (#mcp-sse-wiring)
- **SSE transport for MCP client config** — `McpServerConfig` now supports a `url` field for SSE transport. When `url` is non-empty, `McpClientManager::from_config()` creates an SSE transport instead of stdio. Both `command` (stdio) and `url` (SSE) fields are supported, but not both simultaneously. (#mcp-sse-wiring)
- **MCP SSE integration tests** — New `scripts/lib/test-mcp.sh` with 5 test scenarios: stdio server tools/list, SSE server endpoint + tools/list + tools/call, SSE server health check + 404 handling, SSE client CLI flag verification, and multiple concurrent SSE clients. (#mcp-sse-tests)
- **SSE transport documentation** — Added SSE transport sections to `docs/guides/mcp-integration.md` covering: transport types comparison table, SSE client configuration, SSE server mode (`--mcp-sse-server`), SSE IDE integration (OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, VS Code), and SSE multi-agent workflows. (#mcp-sse-docs)
- **Website SSE transport docs** — Updated `website/public/docs/mcp-integration.html` with transport types table, SSE client config, SSE server endpoint table, IDE integration examples, and "New in v0.9.16" sidebar section. (#mcp-sse-docs)

### Changed
- **`scripts/verify.sh` MODULES array** — Added `mcp` test module for MCP integration tests (stdio + SSE). (#mcp-sse-tests)
- **`McpServerConfig` extended with `url` field** — New `url: String` field (default empty) enables SSE transport. Validation ensures only one of `command` or `url` is set. (#mcp-sse-wiring)
- **`#[allow(dead_code)]` removed from SSE components** — `McpTransportConfig::Sse` variant, `McpSseServer` struct and impl, and `McpClientManager::from_config()` SSE branch all unwired — now fully wired and active. (#mcp-sse-wiring)
- **`lib.rs` re-exports updated** — `McpSseServer` added to public API re-exports. Module description updated to "JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio + SSE". (#mcp-sse-wiring)
- **ROADMAP.md updated for v0.9.16** — SSE MCP items marked complete. v1.0 exit criteria updated. (#roadmap-update)
- **Version bumped to 1.0.0** — Stable release. All v1.0 exit criteria met. (#v1.0-release)

## [v0.9.10] — 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Community health files** — `SECURITY.md` (vulnerability reporting policy, supported versions, security features, supply chain security, hardening roadmap), `CONTRIBUTING.md` (development setup, coding conventions, testing instructions, PR process), `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2.0 with enforcement guidelines), `SUPPORT.md` (documentation links, community channels, commercial support), `.github/FUNDING.yml` (GitHub Sponsors).
- **Issue and PR templates** — `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` (structured bug report with environment, logs, reproduction steps), `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md` (feature request with pillar alignment checklist), `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` (contact links for discussions, docs, security), `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (PR template with type selection, checklist for fmt/clippy/test/docs/CHANGELOG/ROADMAP/ISSUES/binary size).
- **Graceful shutdown for HeartbeatAgent** — Added `impl Drop for HeartbeatAgent` that calls `persist_state()` on drop. State is now saved on graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT) without requiring a signal handler. Ensures heartbeat state survives pod termination.
- **Init container chown in K8s deployment** — Added `initContainers` section to `k8s/deployment.yaml` with `busybox:1.36.1` running `chown -R 65532:65532 /workspace` as root before the main container starts. Ensures workspace is writable by the non-root UID 65532 even with `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`.
- **`--exec` mode documentation** — Added comprehensive `--exec` mode section to `docs/guides/getting-started.md` covering: how `--exec` works, model compatibility table (`FINAL:` marker, structured tool calls, `--no-final-required`), `--no-final-required` flag usage, `--verbose` flag for debugging, and exit codes.
- **Migration docs v0.9.1 → v0.9.2** — Added migration section to `docs/guides/migration.md` documenting: `AgentMessageBus`, `MessageType` enum, `SwarmHealthMonitor`, `WorkerHealthStatus`, `SwarmOrchestrator::new_with_bus()`, and new `[swarm]` config fields (`communication_enabled`, `health_monitoring_enabled`, `heartbeat_interval_secs`, `max_missed_beats`, `replacement_timeout_secs`).
- **Graceful shutdown for all modes** — Added `ShutdownFlag` struct (wraps `Arc<AtomicBool>`) and `ShutdownGuard` struct (logs on drop) in `main.rs`. SIGTERM/SIGINT handler sets the flag. All mode dispatches (single/swarm/supervisor/orchestrate) use `tokio::select!` with `wait_for_shutdown()`. Heartbeat mode checks flag during sleep at 1s granularity.
- **UPX container compression** — Added UPX v5.2.0 installation in Docker builder stage. Both `ravenclaws` and `ravenfabric-agent` binaries compressed with `upx --best --lzma`. Added `INCLUDE_RAVENFABRIC` build arg (default `true`) for conditional RavenFabric agent binary inclusion. Image reduced from ~50 MB to ~25 MB.
- **K8s NetworkPolicy** — Added `ravenclaws-default-deny` NetworkPolicy to `k8s/deployment.yaml` with `podSelector: {}`, `policyTypes: [Ingress, Egress]`, ingress deny all, egress allow DNS (udp 53), HTTPS (tcp 443), HTTP (tcp 80).
- **K8s Secret reference documentation** — Added "Kubernetes Deployment" section to `docs/guides/getting-started.md` with Secret reference table (Key, Description, Example Value columns), `secretKeyRef` YAML examples, and NetworkPolicy explanation.

### Changed
- **ROADMAP.md updated for v0.9.10** — Version bumped from v0.9.9 to v0.9.10. All 4 remaining v0.9.11+ items (container image size, NetworkPolicy, Secret docs, graceful shutdown) marked as completed in v0.9.10. Status tables updated across all sections.
- **AGENTS.md version reference updated** — Version changed from v0.9.7 to v0.9.10.
- **ISSUES.md updated for v0.9.10** — 6 resolved items moved from open to resolved sections. Added ✅ v0.9.10 milestone table.

## [0.9.5] — 2026-06-27

### Added
- **ToolCallDetector — text-based tool call detection fallback** — New `ToolCallDetector` struct with 5 regex patterns for detecting tool calls in natural language text. Acts as a fallback when LLMs don't emit structured `tool_calls`. Includes 11 unit tests covering all patterns, deduplication, and edge cases.
- **Tool execution debug logging** — Enhanced `ToolRegistry::execute()` with `debug!`-level logging of tool arguments and output length. Helps diagnose silent tool failures.
- **`ToolRegistry::with_config()` constructor** — New method that accepts `&Config` to create a registry with configured web search endpoint. Replaces hardcoded SearXNG URL.
- **`run_agent_loop_with_registry()` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp_and_registry()`** — New public API functions that accept an optional pre-configured `ToolRegistry`, allowing callers to pass custom tool configurations (e.g., configured web search endpoint).
- **`--exec` mode uses configured tool registry** — The `--exec` one-shot mode now passes a `ToolRegistry` built from config (via `with_config()`) to the agent loop, so web search endpoint and other tool settings from config are respected.

### Fixed
- **`WebSearchConfig` dead_code warnings removed** — Removed `#[allow(dead_code)]` from `WebSearchConfig` struct and `web_search` field in `Config`. Both are now wired through `ToolRegistry::with_config()`.
- **`ToolCallDetector` and `DetectorPattern` dead_code warnings suppressed** — Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to these types since they are a fallback mechanism used only in tests until wired into the agent loop.

## [0.9.4] — 2026-06-27

### Added
- **`--no-final-required` CLI flag** — New `AgentLoopConfig.no_final_required` field and `--no-final-required` CLI flag. When set, any non-tool-call LLM response is treated as completion (no `FINAL:` marker required). Wired to both `run_agent_loop` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp`. Useful for models that don't reliably emit `FINAL:` convention.
- **Agent loop response logging** — Added `debug!` log after each LLM response in both agent loops, showing response length and first 500 characters of content. Helps diagnose silent failures and model behavior.
- **Default system prompt `FINAL:` instructions** — Updated `default_system_prompt()` in `config.rs` to include `FINAL:` usage instructions, guiding models to signal task completion.
- **`agent_count` serde alias** — Added `#[serde(alias = "agent_count")]` to `SwarmConfig.max_workers` for backward compatibility with configs using the old field name.

### Fixed
- **Heartbeat goal error message** — Improved error message when no goal is provided for heartbeat mode. Now includes a concrete example: `--heartbeat-goal "Monitor system health and report anomalies"`.

## [0.9.3] — 2026-06-27

### Added
- **rpi5 deployment feedback fixes** — Fixed 6 of 12 issues from real-world Raspberry Pi 5 deployment: added `#[serde(alias = "flat")]` to `SwarmTopology::Star` for backward compatibility, fixed all swarm/heartbeat/telemetry/server docs field names (42 incorrect occurrences across 6 files), made OpenTelemetry opt-in by default (`otel_disabled` default changed to `true`). Remaining items tracked in ISSUES.md and ROADMAP.md v1.0 hardening checklist.
- **Provider strategy documented** — Added comprehensive Provider Strategy section to ROADMAP.md covering: generic `openai-compatible` provider (unlocks vLLM, llama.cpp, LM Studio, TGI, Groq, Together AI, Fireworks, DeepInfra, and any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint), vLLM docs/verification tests, llama.cpp docs/verification tests, and Azure OpenAI adapter. Deferred native AWS Bedrock and Gemini/Vertex (reachable via LiteLLM/OpenRouter). Tool-calling fidelity documented per backend.
- **Library API (`src/lib.rs`)** — Added `[lib]` section to `Cargo.toml` and created `src/lib.rs` with public re-exports of all 18 modules. RavenClaws is now usable as both a binary and a library crate (`ravenclaws`).
- **Performance benchmarks** — Verified v1.0 targets: 5.2 MB stripped binary, 5.2 ms cold start. Both well under v1.0 targets (< 15 MB, < 50 ms).
- **API stability guarantees** — `#[non_exhaustive]` added to all public enums (`RavenClawsError`, `ConfigError`, `LLMError`, `ToolError`, `LLMProvider`, `OpenAICompatibleProvider`, `CircuitState`, `ToolCategory`) and public structs (`Config`, `LLMConfig`, `SecurityConfig`, `RuntimeConfig`, `RavenFabricConfig`, `TelemetryConfig`, `SchedulerConfig`, `WebSearchConfig`). Doc comments added to all public types with stability notes.
- **Documentation guides** (`docs/guides/`) — Created comprehensive guides: getting-started, configuration reference, swarm-mode, mcp-integration, and heartbeat-mode. Each guide includes setup instructions, configuration examples, best practices, and use cases.
- **Runnable examples** (`examples/`) — Created 5 runnable Rust examples: `basic_chat` (minimal library usage), `agent_loop` (full agent loop with tools), `swarm` (multi-agent orchestration), `mcp_client` (MCP server connection), `heartbeat` (autonomous agent). Each example is documented with usage instructions.
- **README FAQ section** — Added comprehensive FAQ covering common questions: differentiation, API keys, offline use, security model, mode differences, library usage, upgrade paths, deployment targets, and licensing.
- **Library API re-exports** (`src/lib.rs`) — Added `pub use` re-exports for commonly used types. Added MSRV note (Rust 1.86+), semver guarantees section, and feature flag documentation.

### Removed
- **Deprecated LLM client types** — `LiteLLMClient`, `OpenRouterClient`, `OpenAIClient` (deprecated since v0.5.0) removed. Use `OpenAICompatibleClient` with the appropriate `OpenAICompatibleProvider` variant instead.
- **Legacy `execute_tool_call` function** — Deprecated since v0.4, replaced by `execute_tool_call_with_security` with full PolicyEngine/Sandbox/AuditLog integration.
- **Unused `run_exec_stream` function** — Streaming exec functionality is handled by the agent loop internally.
- **Unused `futures::StreamExt` import** — No longer needed after `run_exec_stream` removal.

### Changed
- **ROADMAP.md** — Updated for v1.0 scope: v0.10 features deferred to post-1.0. v1.0 now focuses on hardening + docs + API stability. Added completed items for deprecated type removal, dead code elimination, library API establishment, performance benchmarks, zero CVEs, API stability, and complete docs. Updated stats to 18 modules, 452 tests. Updated progress to 14/38 v1.0 items.
- **AGENTS.md** — Updated architecture diagram to include `lib.rs`, `eval.rs`, `ravenfabric.rs`. Updated module responsibilities table. Updated build stats (5.2 MB, 5 ms). Updated tool count to 5 built-in tools.
- **README.md** — Updated binary size references from ~3.4 MB to ~5.2 MB. Updated status to v0.9.3. Updated test count to 452. Added library crate mention. Added library usage guide with code example and module table. Updated verification badge to 114 checks. Added library crate badge. Added documentation section with links to all guides. Updated library code example to use new `pub use` re-exports.
- **VERIFICATION.md** — Updated module count from 16 to 18. Updated stale test counts (311→452). Removed duplicate `cargo test` line.
- **deny.toml** — Fixed typo in license exception name (`RavenClawss` → `RavenClaws`).

### Fixed
- **Cargo.toml** — Added missing `homepage`, `documentation`, `readme`, and `exclude` fields for crates.io publication readiness.
- **Dockerfile** — Pinned base image digests for reproducible builds (`rust:1.86-slim-bookworm` and `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian12:nonroot` now use `@sha256:...` digests).

## [0.9.2] — 2026-06-25

  - Task prompts enriched with message bus context for informed decision-making
  - Results broadcast back to the bus for peer awareness
  - CLI flags: `--swarm-communication` (env: `RAVENCLAW_SWARM_COMMUNICATION`)
  - 14 unit tests covering all message bus operations
- **Swarm health & telemetry** (`src/swarm.rs`) — Production-grade health monitoring for swarm agents with heartbeat tracking, dead-agent detection, and aggregate metrics.
  - `SwarmHealthMonitor` — tracks per-worker heartbeats, detects degraded/unhealthy/dead agents, and identifies replacement candidates
  - `WorkerHealthStatus` — four-state health model: Healthy, Degraded, Unhealthy, Dead
  - `WorkerTelemetry` — per-worker metrics: tasks completed/failed, error count, avg duration, messages sent/received, iteration count
  - `SwarmMetrics` — aggregate swarm health: total/healthy/degraded/unhealthy/dead workers, task throughput, worker utilization, error rate, communication latency
  - Heartbeat protocol with configurable interval (default: 5s), max missed beats (default: 3), and replacement timeout (default: 30s)
  - Health monitoring integrated into `execute_with_profile()` and `recursive_supervise_impl()` — workers auto-register, heartbeats update on task completion, failures are tracked
  - Health monitor shared across sub-orchestrators via `Arc<RwLock<>>` for recursive supervision
  - Periodic health check logging in supervisor loop (every 3 iterations)
  - Public accessors: `health_metrics()` and `worker_telemetry()` on `SwarmOrchestrator`

  - 22 unit tests covering all health monitoring operations
  - 452 total unit tests (0 regressions)

## [0.9.1] — 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Self-provisioning of sub-agents** (`src/swarm.rs`) — RavenClaws dynamically spawns new agent instances based on task decomposition. Supervisor mode becomes recursive: supervisors spawn sub-supervisors, creating task decomposition trees of arbitrary depth.
  - `SwarmOrchestrator` — core orchestrator with recursive supervision, task analysis, role assignment, and result aggregation
  - `WorkerProfile` — declarative profile with persona, allowed_tools, provider/model overrides, resource limits, and delegation capability
  - `SwarmTopology` — four topologies: Star, Mesh, Hierarchical, Hybrid
  - `SwarmConfig` — configurable max_depth (default: 3), max_workers (default: 100), dynamic_role_assignment, profiles
  - 5 built-in worker profiles: researcher, creative, executor, reviewer, supervisor
  - Recursive supervision via `Box::pin` to avoid Rust's recursive async fn limitation
  - LLM-based dynamic role assignment (`analyze_task_roles`) with fallback to default roles
  - CLI flags: `--swarm-topology`, `--swarm-max-depth`, `--swarm-max-workers`, `--swarm-dynamic-roles`, `--swarm-profiles`
  - Config section: `[swarm]` in `ravenclaws.toml`
  - Mode dispatch: `--mode orchestrate` for both single-provider and multi-model paths

### Fixed
- **aarch64 build hanging in CI** — Cross-compilation step (`apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`) kept hanging indefinitely on x86_64 GitHub Actions runners. Switched to native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner for aarch64 builds, eliminating the need for cross-compilation entirely. This is faster and more reliable.

- **CodeQL v4 migration** — all `github/codeql-action/*` updated from `@v3` to `@v4`

### Fixed
- **Build Fixes After Upstream Merge (2026-06-02)** — 13+ compilation errors across 6 files resolved:
  - Merge artifacts in `src/main.rs` (duplicate `system_prompt`, stray brace, missing `warn` import, missing `LLMProvider::Anthropic` match arm)
  - Type/lifetime issues in `src/agent.rs` (`&str`/`String` mismatch, `tokio::spawn` lifetime, missing `.clone()` on `Arc`)

  - Missing config fields in `src/config.rs` (47+ test constructors updated)
  - MCP test assertion fix (`protocol_version` → `protocolVersion`)
  - Retry disabled in 7 error-path mockito tests
- **Exec mode test** — fixed `check_llm_response_quality` in `scripts/lib/common.sh` to detect agent loop progress instead of non-existent log message

- **aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu build timeout** — Build & Release #68 failed; added retry loop (3 attempts) and extended timeout to 20 minutes
- **22 pre-existing clippy dead_code warnings** — resolved by replacing deprecated struct usage in tests and adding `#[allow(dead_code)]` to intentionally unused types

### Changed
- Updated ROADMAP.md, ISSUES.md, README.md, AGENTS.md for v0.6 implementation status
- Increased LOC from ~8,900 to ~9,400 (+500 for v0.6 features)
- All 277+ unit tests passing across 9 source modules
