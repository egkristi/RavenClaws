# Changelog

All notable changes to RavenClaw are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Agent communication — structured message passing; conflict resolution across agents (v0.6.2)

## [v0.6.1] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **RavenFabric client module** (`src/ravenfabric.rs`) — full HTTP client for RavenFabric REST API
  - `RavenFabricClient` struct with `new()`, `health()`, `list_agents()`, `execute()`, `broadcast()` methods
  - `ExecuteRequest` / `ExecuteResponse` / `RemoteAgent` types with serde serialization
  - `RavenFabricError` enum with `NotConfigured`, `ConnectionFailed`, `RequestFailed` variants
  - 12 unit tests covering: no-endpoint, with-endpoint, disabled config, error display, connection refused (3), serialization (2), deserialization (3)
- **RavenFabric wiring into all agent modes** — client initialized in `main.rs` from config, passed to all 6 agent mode functions (`run_single`, `run_swarm`, `run_supervisor`, `run_single_multi`, `run_swarm_multi`, `run_supervisor_multi`)
- **RavenFabric status logging** — each agent mode logs whether RavenFabric remote execution is available on startup

### Fixed
- **aarch64 build hanging in CI** — Cross-compilation step (`apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`) kept hanging indefinitely on x86_64 GitHub Actions runners. Switched to native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner for aarch64 builds, eliminating the need for cross-compilation entirely. This is faster and more reliable.

## [v0.6.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Swarm Mode (Single-Provider)** — parallel execution of 3 agents with different personas (analytical, creative, pragmatic); results collected with agent attribution; tokio task spawning for true parallelism
- **Supervisor Mode (Single-Provider)** — task decomposition into subtasks via LLM prompting; sub-agent spawning; result aggregation and final synthesis; security integration (PolicyEngine, Sandbox, AuditLog)
- **Swarm Mode (Multi-Model)** — parallel agents across different LLM providers; provider/model attribution; cost control (capped at 3 agents)
- **Supervisor Mode (Multi-Model)** — provider-aware task decomposition; round-robin supervisor LLM selection; subtask assignment to specific providers based on strengths
- **Git hooks system** — pre-commit and pre-push hooks for automated verification
  - `.githooks/pre-commit` — fast checks: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test --locked`, binary size check, secrets scan
  - `.githooks/pre-push` — comprehensive checks: full pre-commit + release build + binary integrity + Docker build + security scan
  - `.githooks/setup.sh` — install/check/remove hooks with `git config core.hooksPath`
- **CI/CD hardening** — `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`, `-o Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef`, `timeout-minutes: 20`, and retry logic (3 attempts) for cross-compilation dependency install
- **Node.js 24 migration** — `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true` in all 3 workflow files
- **CodeQL v4 migration** — all `github/codeql-action/*` updated from `@v3` to `@v4`

### Fixed
- **Build Fixes After Upstream Merge (2026-06-02)** — 13+ compilation errors across 6 files resolved:
  - Merge artifacts in `src/main.rs` (duplicate `system_prompt`, stray brace, missing `warn` import, missing `LLMProvider::Anthropic` match arm)
  - Type/lifetime issues in `src/agent.rs` (`&str`/`String` mismatch, `tokio::spawn` lifetime, missing `.clone()` on `Arc`)
  - Formatting/borrow issues in `src/llm.rs`, `src/mcp.rs` (double borrow, moved field)
  - Missing config fields in `src/config.rs` (47+ test constructors updated)
  - MCP test assertion fix (`protocol_version` → `protocolVersion`)
  - Retry disabled in 7 error-path mockito tests
- **Exec mode test** — fixed `check_llm_response_quality` in `scripts/lib/common.sh` to detect agent loop progress instead of non-existent log message
- **apt-get hanging in CI** — `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` build was getting stuck indefinitely; added `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` and `timeout-minutes`
- **aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu build timeout** — Build & Release #68 failed; added retry loop (3 attempts) and extended timeout to 20 minutes
- **22 pre-existing clippy dead_code warnings** — resolved by replacing deprecated struct usage in tests and adding `#[allow(dead_code)]` to intentionally unused types

### Changed
- Updated ROADMAP.md, ISSUES.md, README.md, AGENTS.md for v0.6 implementation status
- Increased LOC from ~8,900 to ~9,400 (+500 for v0.6 features)
- All 277+ unit tests passing across 9 source modules
- Binary size: ~3.4 MB (arm64 macOS release build)
- All modes use `FINAL:` marker detection for completion
- Supervisor modes support up to 15 iterations for complex task decomposition
- Subtask agents run with 5-iteration limit each
- Full security wiring (policy, sandbox, audit) preserved in supervisor mode
