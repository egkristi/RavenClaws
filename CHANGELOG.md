## [Unreleased] — v0.6.0-dev

### Fixed — 2026-06-02

#### Build Fixes After Upstream Merge
- Fixed merge artifact in `src/main.rs` — duplicate `system_prompt` line and stray closing brace
- Added missing `warn` import in `src/main.rs`
- Added `LLMProvider::Anthropic` match arm in `main.rs` provider_name mapping
- Fixed `&str`/`String` type mismatch in `agent.rs` swarm_multi (`provider_name()` returns `&str`, tuple expects `String`)
- Fixed lifetime issue: `multi_llm` borrowed in `tokio::spawn` but doesn't live long enough — cloned `Arc` before spawning
- Added missing `.clone()` on `Arc<dyn LLMProviderTrait>` when passing to `run_subtask_agent`
- Fixed `config.provider.clone().into()` → `{:?}` formatting in `llm.rs`
- Changed `&self` to `&mut self` for `chat_with_fallback` to allow `token_budget` mutation
- Fixed double borrow of `self.transport` in `mcp.rs` (3 locations — stored `next_id` in local vars)
- Fixed moved `server_info` field used after move in `mcp.rs` (cloned before move)
- Added missing fields to `LLMConfig::default()` and 47+ test constructors (`token_budget`, `retry_max`, `retry_base_delay_ms`, `retry_max_delay_ms`)
- Fixed MCP test assertion — `protocol_version` → `protocolVersion` (camelCase serde)
- Disabled retries (`retry_max: 0`) in 7 error-path mockito tests to prevent retry count mismatch
- Removed unused `rand::Rng` import in `llm.rs`

### Changed
- Updated ROADMAP.md to reflect v0.6 implementation status
- Added 4 new tests for swarm/supervisor function existence
- Increased LOC from ~8,900 to ~9,400 (+500 for v0.6 features)
- All 277 unit tests passing across 9 source modules
- Binary size: ~3.4 MB (arm64 macOS release build)

### Technical Details
- All modes use `FINAL:` marker detection for completion
- Supervisor modes support up to 15 iterations for complex task decomposition
- Subtask agents run with 5-iteration limit each
- Full security wiring (policy, sandbox, audit) preserved in supervisor mode

### Added — 2026-06-07

#### Swarm Mode (Single-Provider)
- Parallel execution of 3 agents with different personas (analytical, creative, pragmatic)
- Results collected and displayed with agent attribution
- Tokio task spawning for true parallelism
- `run_swarm()` function in `src/agent.rs`

#### Supervisor Mode (Single-Provider)
- Task decomposition into subtasks via LLM prompting
- Sub-agent spawning for each subtask
- Result aggregation and final synthesis
- Security integration (PolicyEngine, Sandbox, AuditLog)
- `run_supervisor()` and `run_subtask_agent()` functions in `src/agent.rs`

#### Swarm Mode (Multi-Model)
- Parallel agents across different LLM providers
- Provider/model attribution in results
- Cost control (capped at 3 agents)
- `run_swarm_multi()` function in `src/agent.rs`

#### Supervisor Mode (Multi-Model)
- Provider-aware task decomposition
- Round-robin supervisor LLM selection
- Subtask assignment to specific providers based on strengths
- `run_supervisor_multi()` function in `src/agent.rs`
