# 🐦‍⬛ RavenClaw Roadmap

**Vision:** RavenClaw shall become the supreme, most trusted, and most capable agentic AI worker, automation agent, and AI assistant.

**Core Principles:**
- **Small** — Not bloated. A lean, focused codebase that does one thing exceptionally well.
- **Sleek** — Elegant architecture. Clean APIs. Minimal cognitive overhead.
- **Secure** — Security by design, not as an afterthought. Fail-closed. Memory-safe.
- **Easy to use** — One command to run. Sensible defaults. Zero-config for common cases.
- **Robust** — Battle-tested. Deterministic. Predictable under load.

## Priority: Critical — v0.1.0 Release Blockers

*Fix critical issues. Ship a working developer preview. Establish trust.*

- [ ] **Fix `--exec` dead code** — CLI arg exists but is never read in `main.rs`. Wire it up or remove the flag.
- [ ] **Fix swarm/supervisor stubs** — `--mode swarm` and `--mode supervisor` print "not yet implemented" and exit 0. Return a clear error instead.
- [ ] **Set up CI/CD pipeline**
  - [ ] GitHub Actions workflow — build binaries for all targets on every push
  - [ ] Release workflow — auto-build and attach binaries to GitHub Releases on tag push
  - [ ] Container registry push — auto-build and push multi-arch Docker images to GHCR on release
- [ ] **Ship pre-built binaries** — Make `curl -LO` installable binaries for all 5 target triples
- [ ] **Expand `cargo test`** — Currently only 2 unit tests. Add tests for config parsing, LLM client creation, error handling, and multi-model manager.
- [ ] **Tag and release v0.1.0** — Create and push version tag

### Key Battlegrounds

1. **Security** — OpenClaw had 15+ CVEs in 2026 alone (sandbox escapes, prompt injection, path traversal, auth bypass). RavenClaw's Rust foundation and fail-closed design are our strongest differentiator. **We must never ship a security vulnerability.**

2. **Performance** — Rust gives us 10-100x faster startup, lower memory, and smaller binaries than Node.js or Python competitors. This matters for edge deployment, serverless, and high-density hosting.

3. **Simplicity** — One binary. Zero dependencies at runtime. No Python runtime, no Node runtime, no virtualenv. `./ravenclaw --mode single` and it works.

4. **Verification** — Our 94-test suite across 8 modules and 4 deployment targets is already more comprehensive than any competitor. We will maintain this as a point of pride.

5. **Open Source + Commercial** — AGPLv3 protects against cloud provider exploitation while the commercial license funds development. MIT alternatives (OpenManus, Vellum) risk the MongoDB/Elasticsearch fate.
