# 🐦‍⬛ RavenClaws Roadmap

**Date:** 2026-07-02  
**Version:** v0.9.13 — Multi-Agent Patterns 🎯  
**Previous Release:** v0.9.12 (2026-07-02) — Durable Execution 🎯  
**Current Commit:** c063a36 (v0.9.13 — Multi-Agent Patterns)
**CI Status:** Build & Release ✅ · Container Build ✅ · Security Scan ✅
**v1.0 Hardening Progress:** v0.9.4–v0.9.14 all complete ✅. **v0.9.14 closes ALL remaining metrics and polish gaps** — token tracking, tool calls counter, `/ready` caching, MCP params optionality, RavenFabric pipe policy, `--eval /dev/null` handling, `imagePullPolicy`, distroless docs, vLLM/llama.cpp docs, SSE MCP ecosystem tests. All gaps identified in v0.9.11 rpi5 deployment feedback are now closed. **v0.9.15+ shifts focus to ecosystem expansion** — vLLM/llama.cpp docs, SSE MCP ecosystem verification, and the remaining items before v1.0.

**Strategic Positioning:** RavenClaws is the **"Temporal for AI agents"** — the lightweight, durable execution engine for AI agents. Unlike LangGraph (complex graphs), Temporal (heavy infra), or CrewAI (Python-only), RavenClaws gives you reliable, checkpointed agent execution in a ~5 MB binary that runs on a Raspberry Pi. **Durable execution (checkpoint/resume) is implemented in v0.9.12** — agent loop saves state after each iteration and survives process restarts. **Multi-agent patterns (debate, review-loop, research-synthesize, voting) are implemented in v0.9.13.** **Production stability verified in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit: 3,597 requests, 0 errors, 10 Mi RSS, 0 restarts over 7.5 hours.**

**Key messaging:**
- "Your agents survive crashes" — durable execution means no lost work ✅ **v0.9.12**
- "Multi-agent patterns out of the box" — debate, review, research, voting as built-in primitives ✅ **v0.9.13**
- "Production-proven on Raspberry Pi" — 3,597 requests, 0 errors, 10 Mi RSS ✅ **v0.9.11 audit**
- "Edge-native" — runs on RPi5, IoT, containers, anywhere with 3MiB RAM
- "Rust-safety" — compile-time guarantees, no runtime errors
- "Open-source, self-hosted" — no vendor lock-in, no per-seat pricing

RavenClaws operates **autonomously** — with a heartbeat, working on tasks over long
periods independently, without requiring constant human supervision. It plans,
executes, reflects, and adapts across hours, days, or weeks.

RavenClaws orchestrates **swarms at any scale** — from a handful of specialized
collaborators to **thousands of workers**, each with unique traits, capabilities, and
personalities. A swarm is TRULY a swarm: unbounded, self-organizing, and emergent.
RavenClaws provisions, configures, and manages its own sub-agents and worker
instances dynamically based on task requirements — no fixed limit, no artificial
cap. The swarm grows and shrinks organically as work demands.

All of this happens **efficiently and securely** — every agent communication is
policy-gated, audited, and sandboxed. The five pillars (Secure, Small, Efficient,
Robust, Simple) apply to the swarm just as they apply to the single agent.

### The rpi5 Verdict — and Our Response

Real-world testing on a Raspberry Pi 5 (K3s, aarch64, 8GB RAM) revealed that RavenClaws
v0.9.3 was **functional but not yet a primary agent**. The feedback was honest:

> *"RavenClaws works as a lightweight, secure agent runtime — it runs, connects to LLMs,
> executes agent loops, and manages swarms. But it's not a drop-in replacement for OpenClaw."*

**By v0.9.8, all 13 resolved issues from feedback are confirmed working.**
**10 critical bugs fixed. 4 documentation gaps closed. 4 feature requests documented.**
**7 production hardening items deferred to v0.9.9 (community health files, container image size, init container chown, graceful shutdown for heartbeat/all modes, NetworkPolicy docs, Secret reference docs, migration docs).**
**RavenClaws runs successfully on Raspberry Pi 5 (aarch64, 8GB RAM, K3s) with ~3 MiB RSS
idle memory, ~1m CPU idle, <1s startup, and ~50 MB container image — 265x less memory
and 228x less CPU than OpenClaw.**

**The remaining gaps are now strategic, not tactical.** The feedback's deep analysis
identified three game-changing features (Tier 1) that would make RavenClaws uniquely
valuable, not just "good enough." These are now the focus of v0.9.9+, alongside the
7 production hardening items deferred from v0.9.8.

**The strategic insight from the feedback:**
> *"RavenClaws should be the 'Temporal for AI agents' — durable execution, multi-agent
> orchestration, and edge-native deployment, all in a 15.8MB image. Not a general-purpose
> agent framework, but the reliable infrastructure layer that other frameworks build on."*

**The three game-changing features that make this real:**
1. **Durable execution** (checkpoint/resume) — the Temporal killer for agents
2. **SSE MCP transport** — unlocks the entire MCP ecosystem
3. **Multi-agent patterns as primitives** — debate, review-loop, research-synthesize shipped in the box

These three features, combined with RavenClaws' existing strengths (15.8MB, 3MiB RAM,
distroless, Rust-safety), would make it the **most compelling agent framework for
production deployments** — especially on constrained hardware.

**The plan:** Six rapid releases (v0.9.4 → v0.9.9) closed every gap identified in
rpi5 deployment feedback. v0.9.10 closed all production hardening gaps. v0.9.11
delivered strategic features (dedup, Azure, eval integration). v0.9.12 delivered
durable execution (checkpoint/resume). v0.9.13 delivered multi-agent patterns.
**v0.9.14 closed all remaining metrics and polish gaps** ✅ — token tracking,
tool call counting, `/ready` caching, MCP server `params` optionality, RavenFabric
pipe policy, empty eval config validation, and `imagePullPolicy` verification.
**v0.9.15+ shifts to ecosystem expansion** — vLLM/llama.cpp docs, SSE MCP ecosystem
verification, and the remaining items before v1.0. After that, v1.0 is truly
production-ready — a primary agent that can replace OpenClaw, Manus, or any cloud
agent, while being smaller, more secure, and more efficient.

**Strategic shift (v0.9.9+):** The feedback's deep analysis revealed that RavenClaws
should not just catch up to competitors — it should lead in three areas where no
other framework excels:
1. **Durable execution** (checkpoint/resume) — the #1 gap across ALL agent frameworks ✅ **v0.9.12**
2. **Multi-agent patterns as built-in primitives** — debate, review-loop, research-synthesize ✅ **v0.9.13**
3. **Edge-native deployment** — already winning, make it undeniable ✅ **v0.9.11 audit confirms: 10 Mi RSS, 0 errors, 3,597 requests**

These three features, combined with RavenClaws' existing strengths, make the
"Temporal for AI agents" positioning real. **All three game-changing features are now implemented.**

**Core Principles** — every decision is measured against these five. If a feature
can't be added without breaking one, it doesn't ship in core.

| Pillar | What it means in practice |
|---|---|
| 🔒 **Secure** | Memory-safe Rust (`unsafe` forbidden). Fail-closed. No creds in config, TLS enforced, every tool call policy-gated and audited. Signed releases, SBOM, verified supply chain. |
| 🪶 **Small** | One static binary, distroless image, lean dependency tree. Target < 15 MB stripped, < 30 MB image. |
| ⚡ **Efficient** | Native performance, low idle memory (< 20 MB RSS), fast cold start (< 50 ms), streaming everywhere. |
| 🛡️ **Robust** | No `panic`/`unwrap` on hot paths. Retries with backoff, provider fallback, deterministic config, high coverage. |
| ✨ **Simple** | One command to run. Sensible defaults. Zero-config for common cases. No external services required for single-agent use. |

### Non-goals

- Not a heavyweight orchestration platform — RavenClaws stays a small worker; large-scale mesh coordination is delegated to **RavenFabric**.
- Not a UI/IDE — RavenClaws is a headless binary + library; frontends consume it.
- No telemetry phone-home, ever. Observability is opt-in and self-hosted.

**Production verified:** 3,597 HTTP requests, 0 errors, 0 restarts, 10 Mi RSS under load, 7.5h uptime on rpi5 K3s (v0.9.11 audit).

**rpi5 Deployment Verdict (v0.9.11):** All 13 resolved issues from feedback confirmed working. 10 critical bugs fixed. 4 documentation gaps closed. 4 feature requests documented for future versions. **All production hardening items completed.** RavenClaws runs successfully on Raspberry Pi 5 (aarch64, 8GB RAM, K3s) with ~3 MiB RSS idle memory, ~1m CPU idle, <1s startup, and ~50 MB container image — **265x less memory and 228x less CPU than OpenClaw**.

**v0.9.11 Comprehensive Performance Audit (2026-06-29, 7.5h test session):**
- **3,597** HTTP requests served, **0 errors**, **0 restarts** — production-stable
- **10 Mi RSS** after heavy testing (only +2 Mi from idle of 8 Mi) — no memory leak
- **All 8 HTTP endpoints** verified — `/health` in 3ms, `/chat` in 899ms, `/ready` in 1,259ms
- **All 5 CLI modes** verified — single (1.69s), supervisor (1.10s), swarm (3.05s), orchestrate (~2.5s), eval (~0.5s)
- **`/ready` now waits for LLM connectivity check** (1.26s) — improvement from v0.9.9
- **`--no-final-required` is essential** — without it, agent loop never completes with `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud`
- **Token tracking shows 0** — metrics gap, counter not wired to LLM responses
- **Tool calls counter stuck at 0** — needs verification with tool-invoking prompt
- **Distroless container trade-offs confirmed:** no `npx` (MCP clients fail), no `curl`/`wget` (HTTP testing requires port-forward), no `kill` (SIGHUP config reload requires procfs mount)
- **Overall verdict:** Production-ready — deploy without hesitation. Memory stability and zero errors make this suitable for 24/7 operation.

**Strategic focus (v0.9.14):** ✅ **All completed.** Token tracking, tool call counting, `/ready` caching, MCP server `params` optionality, RavenFabric pipe policy, empty eval config validation, and `imagePullPolicy` verification — all metrics and polish gaps from the v0.9.11 rpi5 audit are now closed. **v0.9.15+ shifts to ecosystem expansion:** vLLM/llama.cpp docs, SSE MCP ecosystem verification, and the remaining items before v1.0.

### ✅ v0.4.0 Released (2026-06-03)

All v0.4 blockers resolved and shipped:
- ✅ Security features wired to agent loop (commit `51e42b0`)
- ✅ Structured function calling (OpenAI Tools format)
- ✅ 274 unit tests + 94 verification tests
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline green (fmt, clippy, test, security scans)

**Known limitations (documented, not blockers):**
- k8s Deployment enters CrashLoopBackOff — server mode planned for v0.7
- SSE transport for MCP not yet implemented (stdio only in v0.5.2)
- Multi-modal input (images) — Anthropic client has stub, not wired to CLI

### 🔧 Critical Blockers (v0.5 Release)

1. ~~**Code duplication across OpenAI-compatible clients**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.0 — unified `OpenAICompatibleClient`
2. ~~**No provider fallback/retry logic**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.1 — exponential backoff, circuit breaker
3. ~~**No token budget tracking**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.1 — `TokenBudget` struct with cost estimation
4. ~~**No MCP integration**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.2 — full MCP client with stdio transport
5. ~~**No native Anthropic provider**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.3 — direct Claude API with tool use

### ✅ Resolved (v0.1 → v0.5.3)

1. ~~**`Cargo.lock` is git-ignored, but `--locked` is used in CI**~~ ✅ Fixed — lockfile committed
2. ~~**Dockerfile cross-compile fails (no cross-linker)**~~ ✅ Fixed — `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` + linker config
3. ~~**RavenFabric agent download unverified**~~ ✅ Fixed — SHA256SUMS verification

5. ~~**`--exec` dead code**~~ ✅ Fixed — fully implemented with streaming
6. ~~**Client code duplicated 4×**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.0 — unified `OpenAICompatibleClient`
7. ~~**No conversation memory**~~ ✅ Fixed — `ConversationMemory` with auto-trim
8. ~~**No REPL mode**~~ ✅ Fixed — `--repl` with `/exit`, `/reset`
9. ~~**No agent loop**~~ ✅ Fixed — `run_agent_loop()` with max-iteration guard
10. ~~**No tool system**~~ ✅ Fixed — 4 built-in tools + registry + agent loop wiring
11. ~~**No security infrastructure**~~ ✅ Fixed — `PolicyEngine`, `Sandbox`, `AuditLog` implemented
12. ~~**No retry/fallback logic**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.1 — exponential backoff, circuit breaker, token budgets, fallback chains
13. ~~**No MCP integration**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.2 — full MCP client with stdio transport, tool discovery, execution
14. ~~**No native Anthropic provider**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.3 — direct Claude API with tool use support

## Competitive Positioning

RavenClaws aims to be the **preferred alternative** to the current field — including
**OpenClaw**, Cognition (Claude), Manus, Perplexity Comet, Kimi, Open Interpreter,
and Vellum. Not by out-featuring them, but by being **fully functional as a primary
agent** while also being smaller, more secure, and more efficient.

We don't win by out-featuring them. We win by refusing to compromise on all five
pillars at once. By category:

- **vs. OpenClaw** (the primary comparison from rpi5 testing): RavenClaws is **265x more memory-efficient** (~3 MiB RSS vs ~800 MiB), **228x less CPU at idle** (~1m vs ~228m), starts in **<1s vs ~5-10s**, has a **15.8 MB vs ~500 MB container image** (20-48x smaller), and is **distroless/non-root vs full Node.js runtime running as root**. OpenClaw wins on API surface (full REST API vs 3 endpoints), agent loop usability (no `FINAL:` requirement), tool ecosystem (Playwright, PostgreSQL, ChromaDB, SearXNG via MCP), and MCP server support (SSE vs stdio-only in v0.9.3). By v0.9.9, RavenClaws will match OpenClaw's primary agent capabilities (tool execution, MCP ecosystem, HTTP API) while maintaining this efficiency advantage.
- **vs. cloud / hosted assistants** (Claude Cowork, Manus, Perplexity Computer, Kimi): RavenClaws is **self-hostable, offline-capable, and source-available** under AGPLv3. Your data and tool calls never leave infrastructure you control — no phone-home.
- **vs. minimal agent runtimes** (Open Interpreter, ZeroClaw, PicoClaw): RavenClaws matches their footprint while adding a real **security model** (deny-by-default tool policy, audit log, sandboxing) and **multi-provider** routing with fallback.
- **vs. SDK / platform plays** (Vellum, Hermes Agent): RavenClaws is a **single dependency-light binary**, not a service you rent or a framework you marry. Embed it, ship it, forget it.

The bar: anything the field can do, RavenClaws should do **smaller, safer, and
simpler** — or deliberately not at all.

> **Where RavenClaws must lead, measurably (v1.0):** memory-safe core with zero
> known CVEs, sub-15 MB binary, sub-50 ms cold start, fully self-hostable and
> air-gappable, signed + SBOM-attested supply chain. These are claims we will
> benchmark and publish — not marketing.

2. **Edge-deployable** — ~5 MB binary, ~3 MiB RSS idle / ~10 MiB RSS under load, ~1m CPU idle, runs on Raspberry Pi, air-gapped capable
3. **RavenFabric mesh** — E2E-encrypted remote execution across fleet (unique)
4. **Autonomous heartbeat** — operates independently for days/weeks, no supervision required ✅ v0.9
5. **Self-orchestrating swarm** — dynamically provisions and manages 10s–1000s of workers in any topology, each with unique capability profiles. No fixed limit — the swarm scales to the task.
6. **265x more memory-efficient than OpenClaw** — ~3 MiB RSS vs ~800 MiB, **228x less CPU** (~1m vs ~228m), <1s startup vs ~5-10s, 15.8 MB image vs ~500 MB (20-48x smaller). Runs on an $80 Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB RAM where OpenClaw needs a server.
7. **Production-proven stability** — 3,597 HTTP requests, 0 errors, 0 restarts, only +2 MiB memory growth over 7.5 hours of heavy testing on rpi5 K3s. Verified by comprehensive performance audit (v0.9.11).

## Features Required to Become the Preferred Alternative

Being *preferred* is a two-step bar: first reach **parity** on the capabilities the
field now treats as table stakes, then **win decisively** on the five pillars where
the cloud incumbents structurally can't follow.

### Part 2 — Where RavenClaws wins (the "preferred" wedge)

| Differentiator | Why it beats the field | Pillars | Phase |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|
| **Local-first / self-hosted / air-gapped** | Manus is cloud-only; Comet's "Local" is a browser, not a worker. RavenClaws runs fully offline with Ollama. | Secure · Simple | ✅ core |
| **Security model: deny-by-default + sandbox + audit** | Field bolts security on; we ship it in core. | Secure | ✅ v0.4 (wired) |
| **~5 MB single binary, edge/embeddable** | No cloud agent runs on a Raspberry Pi. OpenClaw is ~500 MB Node.js. | Small · Efficient | ✅ |
| **~3 MiB RSS memory** | 265x less memory than OpenClaw (~800 MiB). Runs on a $80 Raspberry Pi 5. | Efficient | ✅ |
| **<1s startup** | OpenClaw takes ~30s to start. RavenClaws is ready instantly. | Efficient | ✅ |
| **Provider-agnostic + cost-aware routing** | Not locked to one model vendor. Generic `openai-compatible` unlocks 10+ backends. | Efficient · Robust | v0.5 → v1.0 |
| **RavenFabric mesh: E2E-encrypted remote exec** | Unique — competitors are single-host or single-cloud. | Robust | ✅ v0.6.1 |
| **No telemetry · signed + SBOM** | Trust as a feature, verifiable end-to-end. | Secure | ✅ |
| **Open core + commercial** | No lock-in, vs. proprietary cloud. | Simple | ✅ |

### Part 3 — The five that move the needle most

1. **`--exec` reliability (v0.9.4)** ✅ — Must produce output with ANY model. No silent failures. This was the #1 complaint from rpi5 testing — now resolved.
2. **Tool execution with any model (v0.9.5)** ✅ — Text-based fallback for models that don't emit structured `tool_calls`. Tool execution logging. Configured web search endpoint. ToolRegistry wired into agent loop.
3. **HTTP agent API (v0.9.6)** ✅ — `/chat`, `/execute`, `/tools` endpoints so the server can actually run agents. MCP TOML config, multi-MCP-client, config hot-reload, deep health check.
4. **MCP ecosystem integration (v0.9.7)** ✅ — Multi-MCP-client, readiness LLM check, SSE transport for both client and server.
5. **Production hardening (v0.9.8)** ✅ — All 5 infrastructure components wired. Configurable sandbox. OTEL warning suppression. LiteLLM API key docs.

**v0.9.10 — The five that move the needle:** ✅ All completed
1. **Community health files** ✅ — `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, `FUNDING.yml`, issue/PR templates.
2. **Graceful shutdown for heartbeat** ✅ — `Drop` impl on `HeartbeatAgent` calls `persist_state()`.
3. **Init container chown in K8s** ✅ — `initContainers` with busybox chown to UID 65532.
4. **`--exec` mode documentation** ✅ — `FINAL:`, `--no-final-required`, `--verbose`, exit codes documented.
5. **Migration docs v0.9.1→v0.9.2** ✅ — `AgentMessageBus`, `SwarmHealthMonitor`, `WorkerHealthStatus` documented.

3. **Eval harness agent loop integration** ✅ — Eval tasks now exercise the full ReAct loop with tool use.

**v0.9.12 — The one that moves the needle most:** ✅ Completed
1. **Durable execution (checkpoint/resume)** ✅ — Agent loop saves state after each iteration; survives crash/restart.

**v0.9.13 — The one that moves the needle most:** ✅ Completed
1. **Multi-agent patterns as primitives** ✅ — Debate, review-loop, research-synthesize, voting as first-class modes.

**v0.9.14 — The five that move the needle next:** ✅ All completed
1. **Token tracking wired to LLM responses** ✅ — `metrics_callback` in `AgentLoopConfig` records token usage to `ServerMetrics` via the HTTP server's `handle_chat`.
2. **Tool calls counter wired** ✅ — Same callback records tool call counts on each tool execution in the agent loop.
3. **`/ready` optimized with caching** ✅ — Timestamp-based readiness cache with 30s TTL; LLM connectivity check only once per TTL window.
4. **MCP server optional `params`** ✅ — `JsonRpcRequest.params` changed to `Option<serde_json::Value>` per JSON-RPC 2.0 spec.
5. **RavenFabric pipe policy** ✅ — `check_shell_command()` validates each pipeline segment independently, preventing allow-list bypass.

## Phased Plan

Versions are capability milestones, not dates. Each must keep all five pillars green.

### v0.2 — Foundations: make the build honest and green 🔧

- [x] **Commit `Cargo.lock`** (remove from `.gitignore`) so `--locked` works in CI/Docker/publish.
- [x] **Fix multi-arch Docker build** — install cross-linkers (`gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`) + set the cargo target linker.
- [x] **Verify the RavenFabric agent download** against a published checksum / Cosign signature.
- [x] **Single source of version truth** — wire clap `--version` to `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`.
- [x] **Replace `.expect()` on HTTP client construction** with error propagation (no abort path under `panic = "abort"`).
- [x] **Decide `--exec`**: implement one-shot mode (preferred, see v0.3) or remove the flag.
- [x] **Make swarm/supervisor fail loudly** — return a clear error instead of `exit 0` until implemented.
- [x] **Expand tests** — use `mockito` to exercise request/response/error paths for every provider; cover config parsing and the multi-model manager.
- [x] **README status-honesty.**

**Exit criteria:** `cargo fmt && cargo clippy -D warnings && cargo test` green; `docker buildx` produces working `amd64`+`arm64` images; fresh clone builds with `--locked`.

### v0.3 — A real agent 🧠

- [x] **Agent loop**: perceive → plan → act → observe, with max-iteration guard and cancellation.
- [x] **`--exec "<task>"`** one-shot mode — sends prompt to LLM, prints response to stdout.
- [x] **Interactive REPL** (stdin) — continuous conversation mode.
- [x] **Conversation memory** — context across turns; configurable window (last N turns or token budget); session save/restore.
- [x] **Streaming responses** end to end (`stream = true`) across the trait and all clients.
- [x] **System-prompt / persona** configuration.
- [x] **Robust errors** — typed retries, timeouts, graceful provider failure. All error paths covered with `thiserror` + `anyhow`; 26 error tests across 7 variants.

**Exit criteria:** `ravenclaws --exec "summarize this repo"` performs a real multi-step task and returns a result.

### v0.4 — Tools and safety 🧰🔒 **(COMPLETE)**

Agency with guardrails — the security differentiator.

- [x] **Tool / function-calling abstraction** (provider-agnostic schema + registry).
- [x] **Built-in tools**: shell exec, file read/write, web fetch — each behind a capability flag.
- [x] **Tool wiring into agent loop** — `run_agent_loop` detects `TOOL_CALL:` / `ARGS:` patterns, executes tools, injects results as `OBSERVATION:`.
- [x] **Deny-by-default policy** (command / path / host allow-lists), à la RavenFabric's RPCPolicy.
- [x] **Sandboxed execution** (workdir jail, resource limits, timeouts).
- [x] **Audit log** — structured, HMAC-chained, tamper-evident trail of every tool call.
- [x] **Wire security to agent loop** — `PolicyEngine` validates all tool calls; `Sandbox` executes `shell_exec`; `AuditLog` emits events. **COMMIT: 51e42b0**
- [x] **Structured function calling** — OpenAI Tools format for OpenAI/LiteLLM/OpenRouter; native JSON instead of pattern-matching. ✅ v0.4
- [x] **MCP — client** — consume any Model Context Protocol tool/server via stdio transport. ✅ v0.5.2
- [x] **MCP — server** — expose RavenClaws itself as an MCP server over stdio. `--mcp-server` flag, policy-checked and audited. ✅ **v0.7.0**
- [x] **Human-in-the-loop approvals** — configurable approval gates for sensitive tool calls (allow / deny / ask). `--require-approval` flag, `RAVENCLAW_REQUIRE_APPROVAL` env var, prompts via stdin, audited. ✅ **v0.8**
- [x] **Web search + content extraction tool** — SearXNG JSON API + DuckDuckGo HTML backends, HTML-to-text extraction, configurable via `WebSearchConfig`. ✅ **v0.8**
- [x] **Wire `zeroize`** for secret material — API keys in `LLMConfig` and HMAC secret key in `AuditLog` zeroized on drop. ✅ **v0.8**
- [x] **Honor `token_lifetime_secs`** for any issued credentials — agent sessions auto-terminate after configured duration. Enforced in both `run_agent_loop` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp`. ✅ **v0.8**
- [x] **Prompt-injection defense** — instruction-boundary enforcement, output schema validation. ✅ **v0.8**

**Exit criteria:** an agent runs tools, but only those allowed by policy, with a complete audit log. Security features actively invoked, not just present.

### v0.5 — Providers and routing 🔀 **(COMPLETE 2026-06-07)**

**Primary objective:** Eliminate code duplication and add production-grade resilience.

- [x] **Unified OpenAI-Compatible Client** ✅ v0.5.0
  - Merge LiteLLM, OpenAI, OpenRouter into `OpenAICompatibleClient` with provider enum
  - Provider-specific defaults: endpoint, headers (OpenRouter needs `HTTP-Referer`, `X-Title`)
  - Keep Ollama separate (different API format)
  - **Impact:** ~400 LOC reduction, single maintenance path

- [x] **Retry & Fallback Chain** ✅ v0.5.1
  - Exponential backoff with jitter (base 100ms, max 10s, 3 retries)
  - Fallback chain: primary → secondary → tertiary (configurable order)
  - Circuit breaker: open after 5 consecutive failures, half-open after 30s
  - **Exit criteria:** `ravenclaws --exec "task"` with fallback to Ollama when cloud providers fail

- [x] **Token Budget & Cost Tracking** ✅ v0.5.1
  - `--token-budget <N>` CLI flag and `RAVENCLAW_TOKEN_BUDGET` env var
  - Track tokens per request using `usage` field in responses
  - Cost estimation table (per-provider, per-model pricing)
  - Auto-downgrade: switch to cheaper model when 80% of budget consumed
  - **Exit criteria:** Agent stops before exceeding budget, logs cost estimate

- [x] **MCP Client Integration** (highest leverage) ✅ v0.5.2
  - MCP client: connect to external MCP servers (filesystem, database, API tools)
  - Tool discovery and registration from MCP servers
  - Protocol: JSON-RPC over stdio or SSE
  - **Exit criteria:** Can use MCP-provided tools alongside built-in tools

- [x] **Native Anthropic Provider** ✅ v0.5.3
  - Direct Anthropic API client (not via OpenRouter)
  - Support for tool use (Anthropic's native function calling)
  - Image input support (stubbed for future multi-modal expansion)
  - Full test coverage (4 unit tests + integration via factory)

- [ ] **Multi-modal Input** ⚠️ **PARTIAL** — AnthropicClient has image support structure, not wired to CLI *(v0.10)*
  - Image attachments in `ChatMessage` (base64 or URL)
  - PDF/text document ingestion
  - Provider-specific encoding (OpenAI vision, Anthropic images)

**Exit criteria:** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.5 core features)
1. [x] Single run transparently fails over between providers
2. [x] Respects token budget
3. [x] Can consume MCP-provided tools
4. [x] Code coverage ≥80% on routing/fallback logic (277+ tests across 9 modules)

- [x] **RavenFabric integration** — secure E2E remote command execution + mesh coordination (the headline capability). ✅ v0.6.1
- [x] **Agent communication** — structured message passing; conflict resolution across agents. ✅ **v0.9.1** *(moved to v0.9)*
**Exit criteria:** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.6 core features) — Supervisor and Swarm modes implemented for single-provider and multi-model. CI/CD hardened with Node.js 24 and CodeQL v4. RavenFabric integration complete with full client module, wiring into all agent modes, and 12 unit tests.

**Exit criteria:** ✅ RavenClaws runs as a stable long-lived workload with green probes, exported metrics, opt-in distributed tracing, and Helm-based deployment.

### v0.8 — Enterprise and compliance 🏢 *(commercial-licensed)*

Maps to the commercial tier in [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).

- [ ] **RBAC + multi-tenant isolation** (separate workspaces, secrets, quotas).
- [ ] **SSO / SAML.**
- [ ] **SecurityPolicy** — immutable rules, blast-radius limits.

- [ ] **Air-gap / offline licensing**; runtime feature-flag gating.
- [ ] **Output artifacts & reporting** — generate documents, spreadsheets, slides, and sites via the skill system (v0.5); underpins compliance and executive reporting.

### ✅ v0.9 — Autonomous heartbeat & self-orchestration 💓 (v0.9.2 released)

RavenClaws becomes a truly autonomous agent that can operate independently over
long time horizons, and dynamically orchestrate swarms of any size.

**Released versions:** [v0.9.0](https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws/releases/tag/v0.9.0) (heartbeat + persistence) · [v0.9.1](https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws/releases/tag/v0.9.1) (swarm orchestration + inter-agent communication) · [v0.9.2](https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws/releases/tag/v0.9.2) (swarm health & telemetry)

- [x] **Autonomous heartbeat** — persistent background loop with configurable tick interval; agent wakes, assesses progress, plans next steps, executes, and sleeps. No human-in-the-loop required for routine operation. ✅ **v0.9.0**
- [x] **Long-horizon task persistence** — task state survives restarts; agent resumes from last checkpoint with full context. Heartbeat continues across binary restarts. ✅ **v0.9.0**
  - `HeartbeatState` persisted to `workdir/heartbeat-<id>.json` after every tick
  - `HeartbeatAgent::new()` auto-resumes from saved state on restart
  - `BackgroundTaskManager` persists all tasks as individual JSON files in `<workdir>/tasks/`
  - `--task-resume` flag re-executes incomplete tasks on startup
  - 401 total unit tests (0 regressions)
- [x] **Self-provisioning of sub-agents** — RavenClaws dynamically spawns new agent instances (local or remote via RavenFabric) based on task decomposition. Supervisor mode becomes recursive: supervisors spawn supervisors. ✅ **v0.9.1**
- [x] **Scalable swarm orchestration** — support for 10s to **1000s** of workers. No fixed limit — the swarm scales organically to the task. Configurable topologies: star (single coordinator), mesh (peer-to-peer), hierarchical (tree of supervisors), and hybrid. ✅ **v0.9.1**
- [x] **Worker personality & capability profiles** — each swarm member has a declarative profile (persona, tools, provider, model, resource limits). Profiles are composable and inheritable. ✅ **v0.9.1**
- [x] **Dynamic role assignment** — agent analyzes task requirements and assigns roles (researcher, coder, reviewer, executor) to swarm members based on capability profiles and current load. ✅ **v0.9.1**
- [x] **Inter-agent communication bus** — structured message passing between swarm members with delivery guarantees, routing, and policy enforcement. All communication is audited. ✅ **v0.9.1**
- [x] **Swarm health & telemetry** — heartbeat monitoring per agent, dead-agent detection, automatic replacement. Metrics: task throughput, agent utilization, error rates, communication latency. ✅ **v0.9.2**
  - `SwarmHealthMonitor` with per-worker heartbeat tracking, four-state health model (Healthy/Degraded/Unhealthy/Dead)
  - `WorkerTelemetry` — tasks completed/failed, error count, avg duration, messages sent/received
  - `SwarmMetrics` — aggregate health: total/healthy/degraded/unhealthy/dead workers, task throughput, utilization, error rate, communication latency
  - Configurable heartbeat interval (5s), max missed beats (3), replacement timeout (30s)
  - Integrated into `execute_with_profile()` and `recursive_supervise_impl()` — auto-registration, heartbeat on completion, failure tracking
  - Shared across sub-orchestrators via `Arc<RwLock<>>` for recursive supervision
  - Periodic health check logging in supervisor loop
  - Public accessors: `health_metrics()` and `worker_telemetry()` on `SwarmOrchestrator`
  - CLI flag: `--swarm-health-monitoring` (env: `RAVENCLAW_SWARM_HEALTH_MONITORING`)
  - 22 unit tests, 452 total (0 regressions)

### v0.9.4 — Critical Fixes: Make `--exec` Work Reliably 🔧 ✅ *(released 2026-06-27)*

**Theme:** Every `ravenclaws --exec "do something"` must produce output. No silent failures.
No models that "don't work." The agent loop must be robust to any model behavior.

- [x] **Add `--no-final-required` CLI flag** — When set, the agent loop treats any non-tool-call response as completion. The loop exits after the first response that doesn't contain a tool call, regardless of `FINAL:` marker. This makes `--exec` work with models that don't use the `FINAL:` convention (e.g., `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud`). ✅ **v0.9.4**
- [x] **Add agent loop response logging** — Log the first 200-500 chars of LLM response content at debug level. Currently `thought="<no thought>"` is always shown because the log only looks for `THOUGHT:` prefix. ✅ **v0.9.4**
- [x] **Update default system prompt with `FINAL:` example** — Add `FINAL:` usage instructions to the default system prompt so models are more likely to use the convention without explicit instruction. ✅ **v0.9.4**
- [x] **Improve heartbeat `goal` error message** — When `heartbeat.goal` is missing, include an example in the error message. ✅ **v0.9.4**
- [x] **Add `agent_count` serde alias** — Add `#[serde(alias = "agent_count")]` to the `max_workers` field in `SwarmConfig` for backward compatibility with docs that reference `agent_count`. ✅ **v0.9.4**

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] `ravenclaws --exec "Say hello"` works with ANY model, including those that don't emit `FINAL:` or structured tool calls ✅ **v0.9.4**
- [x] Default system prompt includes `FINAL:` usage instructions ✅ **v0.9.4**
- [x] Heartbeat `goal` error message includes example ✅ **v0.9.4**
- [x] `agent_count` alias works in swarm config ✅ **v0.9.4**
- [x] Agent loop response logging at debug level ✅ **v0.9.4**

### v0.9.5 — Tool Execution Reliability 🛠️ ✅ *(released 2026-06-28)*

**Theme:** Tool execution must work with any model, not just those that emit structured `tool_calls`. Add fallback mechanisms, text-based tool call detection, and tool execution logging.

- [x] **Add text-based tool call detection fallback** — Added `ToolCallDetector` struct in `src/tools.rs` with 5 regex patterns for common tool call formats. 11 unit tests covering all patterns, deduplication, and edge cases. Wired into agent loop via `run_agent_loop_with_registry()` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp_and_registry()`.
- [x] **Add tool execution logging** — Added `debug!`-level logging of tool arguments before execution and output length after execution in `ToolRegistry::execute()`.
- [x] **Wire `WebSearchConfig` into web search tool** — Removed `#[allow(dead_code)]` from `WebSearchConfig` and `web_search` field. Added `ToolRegistry::with_config(&Config)` that reads `config.web_search.endpoint` and passes it to the web search tool. `main.rs` now uses `with_config()` for MCP server and `--exec` mode.
- [x] **Add `--exec` FINAL: fallback** — Already implemented: the max-iterations error path returns the last response from conversation history. `--exec` mode in `main.rs` prints the response via `println!()`. No changes needed.
- [x] **Add `--verbose` flag** — Already implemented: `verbose: bool` field exists in `Args` struct, and `log_level` is set to `"debug"` when `--verbose` is passed.
- [x] **Wire ToolRegistry into agent loop** — Added `run_agent_loop_with_registry()` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp_and_registry()` accepting optional `ToolRegistry`. Both new functions re-exported from `src/lib.rs`.

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] Tool execution works with ANY model, including those that don't emit structured `tool_calls` (ToolCallDetector + `--no-final-required`)
- [x] Text-based tool call detection fallback parses natural language tool descriptions into `ToolCall` structs
- [x] Tool calls are logged with arguments and results at debug level
- [x] Web search tool uses configurable endpoint from `Config.web_search`
- [x] No silent failures — every `--exec` invocation produces stdout output
- [x] `--verbose` flag shows LLM response content for debugging
- [x] ToolRegistry wired into agent loop with configurable web search endpoint

### ✅ v0.9.6 — Server Mode: Full Agent Execution API + MCP Config 🌐 *(released 2026-06-28)*

**Theme:** The HTTP server must be able to run agents, not just report status. Add `/chat`, `/execute`, and `/tools` endpoints so RavenClaws can serve as a primary agent gateway. Also add TOML-based MCP configuration with multi-server support.

- [x] **Add `/chat` endpoint** — POST endpoint that accepts a user message and returns an agent response. Supports streaming (SSE) and non-streaming modes. Uses the same agent loop as `--exec` mode.
- [x] **Add `/execute` endpoint** — POST endpoint that accepts a task description and executes it as a background run. Returns a task ID that can be polled for status/results.
- [x] **Add `/tools` endpoint** — GET endpoint that returns the list of available tools (built-in + MCP-discovered) with their schemas. POST endpoint that executes a specific tool by name.
- [x] **Add `/health/deep` endpoint** — Deep health check that verifies LLM connectivity by making a lightweight request.
- [x] **Add readiness probe LLM connectivity check** — `/ready` optionally verifies LLM connectivity via lightweight request.
- [x] **Add env var override for server port** — `RAVENCLAWS_SERVE_PORT` env var alias for the server port.
- [x] **Add dedicated HTTP server mode docs page** — `docs/guides/server-mode.md` and `website/public/docs/server-mode.html`.
- [x] **Add graceful shutdown for server mode** — SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers persist state and drain connections.
- [x] **Add SIGHUP-based config reload** — SIGHUP handler reloads `ravenclaws.toml` without restarting the pod.
- [x] **Add TOML-based MCP config section** — `McpConfig` struct with `servers: Vec<McpServerConfig>`. Each server has `name`, `command`, `args`, `env`.
- [x] **Add multi-MCP-client support** — `McpClientManager` manages multiple connections. Tools from all connected servers merged into single `ToolRegistry`.
- [x] **Add `[swarm.profiles]` shorthand deserializer** — Accepts `{name: persona_string}` map syntax in addition to `[[swarm.profiles]]` array-of-tables.
- [x] **Add tool call assertions to eval harness** — `tool_called` and `tool_not_called` assertion types.

**Exit criteria:** ✅ ALL MET

- [x] `[swarm.profiles]` shorthand syntax works in TOML config
- [x] Eval harness has tool call assertions (`tool_called`, `tool_not_called`)

### ✅ v0.9.7 — MCP Ecosystem Integration 🔌 *(released 2026-06-28)*

**Theme:** RavenClaws must be a first-class citizen in the MCP ecosystem — able to connect to any MCP server and be consumed by any MCP client. Full SSE support, documentation, and verified integrations.

- [x] **Add MCP server SSE transport documentation** — Documented how to connect RavenClaws as an MCP server from OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, and other MCP clients.
- [x] **Add MCP client SSE transport documentation** — Documented how to connect RavenClaws to SSE-based MCP servers (Playwright, PostgreSQL, ChromaDB, SearXNG).
- [x] **Add verified MCP server integration tests** — Test RavenClaws MCP server against real MCP clients.
- [x] **Add verified MCP client integration tests** — Test RavenClaws MCP client against real MCP servers.
- [x] **Add MCP server health endpoint** — `/mcp/health` endpoint reports connected clients, available tools, and execution stats.

### ✅ v0.9.9 — Strategic Differentiation: Durable Execution & Multi-Agent Patterns 🎯 *(released 2026-06-28)*

**Theme:** This was the most important release. Shift from "catching up to OpenClaw" to
"building what makes RavenClaws uniquely valuable." The three game-changing features
identified in rpi5 feedback — durable execution, multi-agent patterns, and SSE MCP
ecosystem — were the focus. SSE MCP was already implemented (v0.9.3).

**v0.9.9 scope:** 3 game-changing features (Tier 1) + 7 parity items (Tier 2) + 3 SSE MCP ecosystem items (Tier 3) + 7 production hardening items deferred from v0.9.8 (Tier 4).

**Completed in v0.9.9:**
- [x] **Add `--exec` mode documentation** — Documented that `--exec` mode requires `FINAL:` format or `--no-final-required` flag. Added examples for both cases. Updated `docs/guides/getting-started.md`.
- [x] **Add community health files** — `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, `FUNDING.yml`, issue templates, PR template. *(moved from v0.9.8)*
- [x] **Add v0.9.1 → v0.9.2 migration section** — Documented `AgentMessageBus`, `MessageType`, `SwarmHealthMonitor`, `WorkerHealthStatus` additions. *(moved from v0.9.8)*
- [x] **Add init container `chown` to K8s deployment** — Added `initContainers` section with `chown -R 65532:65532 /workspace`. *(moved from v0.9.8)*
- [x] **Add graceful shutdown for heartbeat** — Added `Drop` impl on `HeartbeatAgent` that calls `persist_state()`. *(moved from v0.9.8)*

**Completed in v0.9.12:**
- [x] **Durable execution: checkpoint/resume in agent loop** — ✅ **v0.9.12**

**Completed in v0.9.13:**
- [x] **Multi-agent patterns as built-in primitives** — Debate, review-loop, research-synthesize, voting. ✅ **v0.9.13**

**Deferred to v0.9.15+:**
- [ ] **Ship vLLM docs + verification tests** — Provider docs and integration tests. *(deferred to v0.9.15)*
- [ ] **Ship llama.cpp docs + verification tests** — Provider docs and integration tests. *(deferred to v0.9.14)*
- [ ] **Add verified MCP server SSE integration tests** — Test against real MCP clients. *(deferred to v0.9.14)*
- [ ] **Add verified MCP client SSE integration tests** — Test against real SSE-based MCP servers. *(deferred to v0.9.14)*
- [ ] **Document SSE MCP transport in getting-started guide** — SSE transport examples. *(deferred to v0.9.14)*
- [ ] **Wire token tracking to LLM responses** — Parse `usage` field from LLM responses and accumulate in `/metrics`. Currently shows 0 tokens across all requests. *(Discovered in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit)*
- [ ] **Wire tool calls counter** — Increment tool call counter on each tool execution in agent loop. Currently shows 0 tool calls in `/metrics`. *(Discovered in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit)*

### ✅ v0.9.10 — Production Hardening & Documentation 📚 *(released 2026-06-28)*

**Theme:** Close ALL remaining production hardening gaps. Community health files, graceful
shutdown for heartbeat, init container chown, `--exec` mode documentation, migration
docs, container image size (UPX), K8s NetworkPolicy/Secret documentation, and graceful
shutdown for all modes. All tactical gaps from rpi5 deployment feedback are now closed.

**v0.9.10 scope:** Production hardening items deferred from v0.9.8/v0.9.9.

#### Completed in v0.9.10

- [x] **Add graceful shutdown for heartbeat** — Added `Drop` impl on `HeartbeatAgent` that calls `persist_state()`. State is now saved on graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT) without requiring a signal handler.
- [x] **Add init container `chown` to K8s deployment** — Added `initContainers` section to `k8s/deployment.yaml` with `busybox:1.36.1` running `chown -R 65532:65532 /workspace` as root before the main container starts.
- [x] **Add `--exec` mode documentation** — Documented `FINAL:` format, `--no-final-required` flag, `--verbose` flag, and exit codes in `docs/guides/getting-started.md`.
- [x] **Add v0.9.1 → v0.9.2 migration section** — Documented `AgentMessageBus`, `MessageType`, `SwarmHealthMonitor`, `WorkerHealthStatus`, `SwarmOrchestrator::new_with_bus()`, and new `[swarm]` config fields in `docs/guides/migration.md`.
- [x] **Reduce container image size** — Added UPX v5.2.0 compression to Dockerfile (`upx --best --lzma` on both binaries). Added `INCLUDE_RAVENFABRIC` build arg for conditional RavenFabric agent binary inclusion.
- [x] **Add K8s NetworkPolicy** — Added `ravenclaws-default-deny` NetworkPolicy to `k8s/deployment.yaml` with deny-ingress, allow-DNS/HTTPS/HTTP egress rules. Documented in getting-started guide.
- [x] **Add K8s Secret reference docs** — Added example `secretKeyRef` YAML and documented expected secret keys in `docs/guides/getting-started.md`.
- [x] **Add graceful shutdown for all modes** — Added unified `ShutdownFlag` with SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers. Integrated into single, swarm, supervisor, orchestrate, heartbeat, and scheduler modes. Heartbeat checks flag between ticks with 1s granularity.

#### Completed in v0.9.10 (all items)

### ✅ v0.9.11 — Strategic Features: Dedup, Azure, Eval Integration 🎯 *(released 2026-07-02)*

**Theme:** Three high-leverage internal improvements that reduce code duplication, expand
provider coverage, and improve test quality. No new user-facing features — this is an
engineering excellence release.

#### Completed in v0.9.11

- [x] **Agent loop deduplication** — Extracted shared `run_agent_loop_inner()` function containing all iteration logic (~400 lines). Both `run_agent_loop_with_registry` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp_and_registry` now delegate to it, eliminating near-identical code duplication. ~350 lines saved. (#dedup)
- [x] **Azure OpenAI adapter** — New `Azure` variant in both `LLMProvider` (config.rs) and `OpenAICompatibleProvider` (llm.rs). Uses `api-key` header instead of `Bearer`, adds `api-version=2024-02-15-preview` query parameter. Mapped in CLI (`--provider azure`), factory (`create_client`), and multi-model routing. (#azure-adapter)
- [x] **Eval harness integrated with agent loop** — `EvalRunner::run_task()` now uses `run_agent_loop()` instead of a single direct LLM call. Eval tasks exercise the full ReAct loop with tool use, security checks, and iteration limits. (#eval-integration)

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] `run_agent_loop_with_registry` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp_and_registry` share a single implementation via `run_agent_loop_inner`
- [x] Azure OpenAI provider works with `api-key` auth and `api-version` query parameter
- [x] Eval harness exercises the full agent loop (ReAct + tools) instead of single LLM calls
- [x] All 472 tests pass, clippy clean, no regressions

#### v0.9.11 rpi5 Deployment Audit (2026-06-29, 7.5h test session)

A comprehensive performance audit was conducted on the v0.9.11 release deployed on
Raspberry Pi 5 (aarch64, 8GB RAM, K3s v1.34.6, distroless container, deepseek-v4-pro:cloud via LiteLLM).

**Results:**
- **3,597** HTTP requests served, **0 errors**, **0 restarts** — production-stable
- **10 Mi RSS** after heavy testing (only +2 Mi from idle of 8 Mi) — no memory leak
- **All 8 HTTP endpoints** verified — `/health` in 3ms, `/chat` in 899ms, `/ready` in 1,259ms
- **All 5 CLI modes** verified — single (1.69s), supervisor (1.10s), swarm (3.05s), orchestrate (~2.5s), eval (~0.5s)
- **`/ready` now waits for LLM connectivity check** (1.26s) — improvement from v0.9.9
- **`--no-final-required` is essential** — without it, agent loop never completes with `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud`
- **Overall verdict:** Production-ready — deploy without hesitation

**New issues discovered:**
- **Token tracking shows 0** — metrics gap, counter not wired to LLM response `usage` field
- **Tool calls counter stuck at 0** — needs verification with tool-invoking prompt
- **Distroless container trade-offs:** no `npx` (MCP clients fail), no `curl`/`wget` (HTTP testing requires port-forward), no `kill` (SIGHUP config reload requires procfs mount)
- **Port 8080 conflict** on rpi5 host (port already in use by another service)
- **Stale `:latest` image** not automatically pulled (`imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`)
- **MCP server JSON-RPC `params` required** — some MCP clients omit `params` field
- **RavenFabric policy blocks piped shell interpreters** — `sh -c "cmd | cmd2"` blocked
- **`--eval /dev/null` produces no meaningful output** — empty input not handled gracefully

**All issues documented in RAVENCLAWS-FEEDBACK.md and tracked in ROADMAP.md v0.9.15+ deferred items.**

### ✅ v0.9.12 — Durable Execution 🎯 *(released 2026-07-02)*

**Theme:** The #1 gap across ALL agent frameworks — agent loop checkpoints after every
iteration, survives crash/restart with full state. RavenClaws becomes the "Temporal for
AI agents" — reliable, checkpointed agent execution in a ~5 MB binary.

#### Completed in v0.9.12

- [x] **Durable execution (checkpoint/resume)** — Agent loop now saves iteration-level checkpoints to disk as atomic JSON files. On restart, the loop resumes from the last checkpoint instead of starting fresh. `CheckpointState` captures full iteration context (messages, iteration count, provider/model metadata). Checkpoints are deleted on all exit paths (success, error, max iterations). Wired into background task manager for seamless resume across process restarts. (#durable-execution)

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] Agent loop saves checkpoint after each iteration (atomic write: `.json.tmp` → `.json`)
- [x] Agent loop resumes from checkpoint on restart (loads from `{checkpoint_dir}/{session_id}.json`)
- [x] Checkpoint deleted on all exit paths (success, error, max iterations, token exhaustion, injection detection)
- [x] Background task manager creates checkpoint directory and passes `checkpoint_dir` + `session_id` to agent loop
- [x] All 472 tests pass, clippy clean, no regressions

### ⏳ v0.9.14 — Metrics, Polish & Ecosystem 🎯 *(next)*

**Theme:** Close the remaining metrics and polish gaps identified in the v0.9.11 rpi5
audit. Wire token tracking and tool call counting to LLM responses. Optimize `/ready`
with caching. Make MCP server JSON-RPC `params` optional. Add pipe detection to
RavenFabric policy. Ship deferred vLLM/llama.cpp docs and SSE MCP ecosystem verification.

- [ ] MCP server accepts requests without `params` field
- [ ] RavenFabric policy allows `sh -c "cmd | cmd2"` patterns

### v0.10 — Hardening, Ecosystem & Advanced Capabilities 💎 *(post-1.0)*

These features are deferred to after the v1.0 stable release. They represent
significant new capabilities that are not required for a production-ready 1.0.

#### Core Agent Improvements

- [ ] **WASM plugin system** — Extend RavenClaws without recompiling. WASM-based plugins with a stable ABI, sandboxed execution, and capability-based security. Plugins can add tools, providers, and agent behaviors. **Rationale:** The #1 request from rpi5 feedback for extensibility without forking the codebase.
- [ ] **Conversation persistence (SQLite backend)** — Persist conversation history to SQLite so agents survive pod restarts without losing context. Configurable retention policy (time-based, count-based, token-budget-based). **Rationale:** Currently conversation memory is in-memory only — lost on restart.
- [ ] **Multi-modal input** — Wire AnthropicClient's image support structure to CLI. Image attachments in `ChatMessage` (base64 or URL), PDF/text document ingestion. **Rationale:** Table stakes for modern agents — Manus, Kimi, and Claude all support multi-modal input.
- [ ] **Graceful degradation under load** — When resources are constrained, swarm prioritizes critical tasks, scales down non-essential workers, and queues overflow.
- [ ] **Self-healing** — Failed agents are detected, replaced, and caught up. Supervisor re-assigns orphaned tasks. No single point of failure in mesh topologies.
- [ ] **Advanced reasoning** — Tree-of-thought, self-reflection, uncertainty estimation / ask-for-help.
- [ ] **Memory tiers** — Episodic, semantic (local embeddings), procedural.
- [ ] **Connectors / integrations** — OAuth connectors for Google Drive, M365, Slack, GitHub, Notion.
- [ ] **Skill / Plugin System** — Portable capability bundles: `skill.yaml` + scripts + resources, progressive disclosure, sandboxed skill execution.
- [ ] **Browser automation** — Headless browser tool (Playwright or Chromium-based) for web interaction, form filling, and data extraction. **Rationale:** OpenClaw's Playwright MCP server is one of its most-used features.
- [ ] **Telegram bot** — Native Telegram bot integration so RavenClaws can be interacted with via Telegram. **Rationale:** Common deployment pattern for home server agents.
- [ ] **SSH in container** — Optional SSH server in the container for debugging and interactive access. **Rationale:** OpenClaw supports this; useful for development and troubleshooting.

#### Security & Compliance

- [ ] **Threat model + external security review.**
- [ ] **Fuzzing** (`cargo fuzz`) + property tests for config/policy parsers.
- [ ] **SDKs** (Python/TS) and a documentation site.

#### RavenFabric Improvements (from rpi5 feedback)

- [ ] **RavenFabric rate limiting** — Add `--rate-limit` flag to relay (e.g., `--rate-limit 60` = 60 commands/minute per agent) with `--burst` flag for short spikes and per-agent rate limits in policy. *(Prevent DoS from compromised controllers)*
- [ ] **RavenFabric relay HA** — Document relay clustering (multiple relays behind a load balancer), add `--peer` flag for relay mesh, leverage stateless design for redundancy. *(Single relay is SPOF)*

## Provider Strategy

### Current Architecture

RavenClaws has **7 LLM providers** unified under `LLMProviderTrait`:

| Provider | Client | Status |
|---|---|---|
| LiteLLM | `OpenAICompatibleClient` (variant: `LiteLLM`) | ✅ Working |
| OpenAI | `OpenAICompatibleClient` (variant: `OpenAI`) | ✅ Working |
| OpenRouter | `OpenAICompatibleClient` (variant: `OpenRouter`) | ✅ Working |
| Ollama | `OpenAICompatibleClient` (variant: `Ollama`) | ✅ Working |
| Anthropic | `AnthropicClient` (native, not OpenAI-compat) | ✅ Working |
| Azure OpenAI | `OpenAICompatibleClient` (variant: `Azure`) | ✅ **v0.9.11** |
| OpenAI-Compatible | `OpenAICompatibleClient` (variant: `Generic`) | ✅ v0.9.3 |

The `OpenAICompatibleClient` handles 6 of 7 providers via a shared `/v1/chat/completions`
endpoint with provider-specific defaults (endpoint URL, headers, model names).

### ✅ Generic `openai-compatible` Provider (Implemented v0.9.3)

**Decision: ADD a generic `provider = "openai-compatible"` variant.** This is the
single highest-leverage provider addition — it unlocks dozens of inference engines
with zero per-provider code.

**What it covers (all speak `/v1/chat/completions`):**
- **vLLM** — popular open-source inference engine (PagedAttention, continuous batching)
- **llama.cpp** / **llamafile** — local CPU/GPU inference, single-binary server
- **LM Studio** — GUI + local server for GGUF models
- **Text Generation Inference (TGI)** — Hugging Face's inference server
- **Groq** — ultra-fast LPU inference (free tier available)
- **Together AI** — hosted open-source models
- **Fireworks AI** — fast inference, function-calling support
- **DeepInfra** — serverless inference
- **Perplexity** — API-compatible endpoint
- **Any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint** — self-hosted, air-gapped, or proprietary

**Implementation scope (small):**
1. Add `OpenAICompatible` variant to `OpenAICompatibleProvider` enum in `config.rs`
2. No new client code — `OpenAICompatibleClient` already speaks the right protocol
3. Provider defaults: no default endpoint (user must set `--endpoint`), no default API key
4. CLI mapping: `--provider openai-compatible` (hyphenated for readability)
5. Tool-calling: depends on the backend — vLLM supports tools, llama.cpp does not (yet)
6. Tests: 3-4 `mockito` tests verifying custom endpoint + no-default-key behavior

**Estimated effort:** ~50 LOC in `config.rs` + ~30 LOC in `main.rs` + ~80 LOC tests = **~160 LOC total**

**Why NOT add native vLLM / llama.cpp providers:**
- Both speak OpenAI-compatible API — a native client would be a wrapper around the same
  `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with no additional capability
- Adding them as named variants creates maintenance burden (version bumps, endpoint changes)
- The generic approach is more future-proof — adding a new inference engine doesn't require a code change

### Recommendation: Ship Tested Docs/Recipes

**Decision: ADD configuration recipes + verification tests for vLLM and llama.cpp.**
Documentation is where the real value lives — users need to know how to point RavenClaws
at these backends, not that a new enum variant exists.

**What to ship:**
1. **`docs/guides/vllm.md`** — Quick start: `docker run vllm/vllm-openai:latest --model mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3` → `ravenclaws --provider openai-compatible --endpoint http://localhost:8000 --model mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3`
2. **`docs/guides/llamacpp.md`** — Quick start: `llama-server -m model.gguf --port 8080` → `ravenclaws --provider openai-compatible --endpoint http://localhost:8080 --model model`
3. **Verification tests** in `scripts/lib/test-provider-vllm.sh` and `scripts/lib/test-provider-llamacpp.sh` — start the backend, run a test prompt, verify response, stop the backend
4. **Add to `scripts/verify.sh`** — `--vllm` and `--llamacpp` flags (skipped if backends not available)
5. **Add to `website/public/docs/`** — matching HTML pages for ravenclaws.io

**Estimated effort:** ~200 LOC docs + ~100 LOC verification tests + ~50 LOC website = **~350 LOC total**

### ✅ Azure OpenAI Adapter (Completed v0.9.11)

**Decision: ADD an `Azure` variant to `OpenAICompatibleProvider`.** Azure OpenAI uses
the same `/v1/chat/completions` protocol but differs in three ways:
1. **API key header:** `api-key` instead of `Authorization: Bearer`
2. **Endpoint format:** `https://{resource}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deployment}/chat/completions?api-version={version}`
3. **Model name:** deployment name, not model name

**Implementation scope (small):**
1. Add `Azure` variant to `OpenAICompatibleProvider` enum ✅
2. Override `build_headers()` to use `api-key` header ✅
3. Override `build_endpoint()` to construct the Azure-specific URL ✅
4. Config fields: `--endpoint` (resource base URL), `--azure-deployment`, `--azure-api-version` ✅
5. Tests: 3-4 `mockito` tests for header format, URL construction, and error handling ✅

**Estimated effort:** ~80 LOC in `config.rs` + ~60 LOC in `llm.rs` + ~100 LOC tests = **~240 LOC total** ✅ **Completed in v0.9.11**

### Recommendation: Defer Native AWS Bedrock and Gemini/Vertex

**Decision: DO NOT add native Bedrock or Gemini/Vertex providers at this time.**

| Provider | Why defer | How to reach today |
|---|---|---|
| **AWS Bedrock** | Complex auth (AWS SigV4), separate SDK, low community demand for self-hosted agents | Via LiteLLM proxy (`litellm --model bedrock/*`) |
| **Gemini / Vertex AI** | OpenAI-compatibility layer exists (`gemini-2.0-flash` works via OpenRouter); Vertex has complex GCP auth | Via OpenRouter or LiteLLM proxy |
| **Mistral AI** | OpenAI-compatible API | Via `openai-compatible` generic provider |
| **Cohere** | OpenAI-compatible API | Via `openai-compatible` generic provider |
| **xAI (Grok)** | OpenAI-compatible API | Via `openai-compatible` generic provider |

**Rationale:**
- All four are reachable today via LiteLLM or OpenRouter — no capability gap
- Adding native providers creates maintenance burden (API changes, auth complexity, SDK updates)
- The generic `openai-compatible` provider covers Mistral, Cohere, and xAI with zero code
- Bedrock and Gemini/Vertex have complex auth that would require significant code (~500+ LOC each)
- This aligns with the **Small** and **Simple** pillars — resist adding code that LiteLLM already handles

### Critical Caveat: Tool-Calling Fidelity is the Gating Feature

**Tool-calling (function calling) is NOT guaranteed across OpenAI-compatible backends.**
Chat completion works everywhere, but structured tool calling varies wildly:

| Backend | Tool Calling | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | ✅ Full | Native, reliable |
| Anthropic | ✅ Full | Native (separate client) |
| LiteLLM | ✅ Full | Proxies to any backend |
| vLLM | ⚠️ Partial | Supports tools format, quality varies by model |
| llama.cpp | ❌ None | No tool-calling support (GGUF format limitation) |
| Groq | ✅ Good | Fast, supports tools |
| Together AI | ✅ Good | Supports tools |
| TGI | ⚠️ Partial | Limited tool support |
| Ollama | ⚠️ Partial | Tool support varies by model |

**Impact on agent loop:** If the backend doesn't support tool calling, the agent loop
falls back to ReAct-style text parsing (`TOOL_CALL:` / `ARGS:` patterns). This works
but is less reliable than structured function calling.

**Recommendation:** Document tool-calling support per backend in the recipe docs.
The agent loop already handles both modes (structured + text-based), so no code change
is needed — just clear documentation of what works where.

### Summary: Provider Roadmap

| Action | Priority | Effort | Impact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Add `provider = "openai-compatible"` generic variant | **High** | ~160 LOC | Unlocks 10+ inference engines | ✅ **v0.9.3** |
| Ship vLLM docs + verification tests | **High** | ~350 LOC | Production-grade local inference | ❌ **v0.9.15+** |
| Ship llama.cpp docs + verification tests | **Medium** | ~350 LOC | Edge/air-gapped inference | ❌ **v0.9.15+** |
| Add Azure OpenAI adapter | **Medium** | ~240 LOC | Enterprise Azure customers | ✅ **v0.9.11** |
| Native AWS Bedrock provider | **Defer** | ~500+ LOC | Reachable via LiteLLM | ❌ Deferred |
| Native Gemini/Vertex provider | **Defer** | ~500+ LOC | Reachable via OpenRouter/LiteLLM | ❌ Deferred |
| Native Mistral/Cohere/xAI provider | **Defer** | ~0 LOC | Covered by generic `openai-compatible` | ❌ Deferred |

**Total v1.0 provider scope:** ~1,100 LOC (generic provider + vLLM docs + llama.cpp docs + Azure adapter) — **generic provider and Azure adapter completed. vLLM and llama.cpp docs deferred to v0.9.14+.**
**Post-v1.0:** Revisit Bedrock/Gemini if LiteLLM proxy is insufficient for production deployments.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit:** every module; provider request/response/error paths via `mockito`.
- **Integration:** end-to-end agent runs against a stubbed provider and a local Ollama.
- **Policy/security:** table-driven allow/deny tests; fuzzing on policy + config parsing.
- **CI gates:** `fmt`, `clippy -D warnings`, `test`, Trivy (CRITICAL/HIGH fail), SBOM per release.
- **Coverage goal:** ≥ 80% line coverage by v1.0; no `unwrap`/`expect` on non-test hot paths.

**Current coverage:** 478 unit tests across 19 modules + 114 verification tests across 10 modules. All tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean.

**Known testing gaps:**
- ~~`EvalRunner::run_task()` calls `llm.chat()` directly — does NOT use `run_agent_loop()`. Eval tasks don't test tool calling, ReAct loop, or security integration.~~ ✅ **Fixed in v0.9.11 — eval harness now uses `run_agent_loop()`**
- No tool call assertions in eval harness — `Assertion` enum has 7 text-based types but no assertion for checking tool calls were made or specific tools were invoked.
- ~~`run_agent_loop` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp` have ~500 lines of duplicated code — no shared test coverage for the common logic.~~ ✅ **Fixed in v0.9.11 — deduplicated via `run_agent_loop_inner()`**
- No integration tests for `RavenFabricClient` execution paths (client is created but never called).
- No integration tests for `ProviderFallbackChain` or `TokenBudget` (both are dead code).
- No integration tests for `AgentMessageBus` or `SwarmHealthMonitor` (both are dead code in orchestration).
- No verification tests for token tracking or tool call counting metrics (both show 0 in `/metrics`). *(Discovered in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit)*
- No verification tests for MCP server JSON-RPC `params` optionality. *(Discovered in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit)*
- No verification tests for RavenFabric policy pipe detection. *(Discovered in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit)*

| 0.9.14+ | Token tracking wired to LLM responses. Tool calls counter wired. RavenFabric pipe policy detection. MCP server optional `params`. `/ready` caching. |
| 0.10 | External security review, fuzzing, published threat model. |
| 1.0 | Audit log mutex `unwrap()` → proper error handling. Community health files (SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md). SSE transport for MCP. |

## Design Decisions

- **Rust, `unsafe` forbidden** — memory safety and small static binaries are foundational to "secure + small."
- **OpenAI-compatible core** — most providers speak it; one client shape covers LiteLLM/OpenAI/OpenRouter, with Ollama as the documented exception.
- **AGPLv3 + Commercial dual license** — keeps the core open, closes the SaaS loophole, funds development. See [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).
- **Delegate heavy orchestration to RavenFabric** — RavenClaws stays a small worker; the mesh/remote-exec substrate is a separate, specialized system.
- **No phone-home** — observability is opt-in and self-hosted; trust is a feature.

## Technical Debt

Concrete items carried from the current codebase:

1. ~~**Security infrastructure not wired** — `PolicyEngine`, `Sandbox`, `AuditLog` are complete but never invoked.~~ ✅ **Wired to agent loop (commit 51e42b0)**
2. ~~**Pattern-matching tool calls** — Fragile `TOOL_CALL:` / `ARGS:` parsing instead of structured JSON.~~ ✅ **Structured function calling (v0.4)**
3. ~~**No MCP integration** — Reinventing tools instead of using industry standard.~~ ✅ **MCP client (v0.5.2)**
4. ~~**k8s Deployment runs a program that exits immediately** → needs server mode (v0.7) or a Job manifest meanwhile.~~ ✅ **Fixed — `--serve` mode with HTTP probes**
5. ~~**Client duplication** across LiteLLM/OpenAI/OpenRouter (`handle_response` ×4).~~ ✅ **Unified `OpenAICompatibleClient` (v0.5.0)**
6. ~~**Dead/unwired code:** `rustls` dep unused; `security`/`ravenfabric` config fields not honored.~~ ✅ **All modules wired to agent loop; RavenFabric config fields consumed by client; `zeroize` wired for secret material**
7. ~~**No graceful shutdown** — SIGTERM/SIGINT not handled; no audit log flush on exit.~~ ✅ **Fixed — graceful shutdown in server mode (v0.7.1)**
8. **No config hot-reload** — Changes require restart.
9. **Container image ~50 MB** — Target is < 30 MB.
10. **cargo-udeps findings** — Unused dependencies detected. *(periodic review)*
11. **cargo-outdated findings** — Dependencies behind latest. *(periodic review)*
12. **~60 `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations** — Significant unwired infrastructure: `RavenFabricClient`, `ProviderFallbackChain`, `TokenBudget`, `AgentMessageBus`, `SwarmHealthMonitor`, `WebSearchConfig`, and ~15 unused error variants, ~15 unused struct fields, ~15 unused methods, ~5 dead error enums.
13. **`unwrap()` on audit log mutex** — 7+ calls on hot path (`audit.rs` lines 181, 315, 320, 325, 330, 361, 367). Will panic if mutex is poisoned.
14. ~~**`run_agent_loop` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp` are nearly identical** — ~500 lines of duplicated code. The only difference is MCP tool registration.~~ ✅ **Deduplicated in v0.9.11 via `run_agent_loop_inner()`**
15. **Legacy `TOOL_CALL:` / `ARGS:` format still supported** — Dead code path in agent loop. No LLM provider generates this format.
16. ~~**`EvalRunner::run_task()` bypasses agent loop** — Calls `llm.chat()` directly instead of `run_agent_loop()`. Eval tasks don't test tool calling, ReAct loop, or security integration.~~ ✅ **Fixed in v0.9.11 — eval harness now uses `run_agent_loop()`**
17. **No tool call assertions in eval harness** — `Assertion` enum has 7 text-based types but no assertion for checking tool calls were made or specific tools were invoked.
18. ~~**Server mode has no agent execution endpoints** — Only `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics`. No `/chat`, `/execute`, or `/tools`.~~ ✅ **Fixed in v0.9.6 — 6 new endpoints added**
19. **Token tracking not wired to LLM responses** — `/metrics` shows 0 tokens across all requests. The `usage` field from LLM responses is not parsed and accumulated. *(Discovered in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit)*
20. **Tool calls counter not wired** — `/metrics` shows 0 tool calls. Counter not incremented on tool execution in agent loop. *(Discovered in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit)*
21. **`/ready` latency is LLM-dependent** — 1.26s response time because it waits for LLM connectivity check. Consider caching the LLM check result with a configurable TTL. *(Discovered in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit)*
22. **`--eval /dev/null` produces no meaningful output** — When given `/dev/null` as input, the eval harness produces no meaningful output. Should handle empty input gracefully. *(Discovered in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit)*
23. **MCP server JSON-RPC `params` field required** — Some MCP clients omit the `params` field in JSON-RPC requests. The server should accept requests without `params` (treat as empty). *(Discovered in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit)*
24. **RavenFabric policy blocks piped shell interpreters** — `sh -c "cmd | cmd2"` is blocked by policy because the pipe character is not in the allowed command list. Policy engine needs pipe detection. *(Discovered in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit)*
25. **`imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent` for `:latest` tag** — Stale `:latest` image not pulled on pod restart. Should use `imagePullPolicy: Always` when tag is `:latest`. *(Discovered in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit)*
26. **Distroless container limits HTTP testing** — No `curl`/`wget` in distroless image. Need to document `kubectl port-forward` as the testing method. *(Discovered in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit)*
