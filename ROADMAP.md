# 🐦‍⬛ RavenClaws Roadmap

**Date:** 2026-06-27  
**Version:** v0.9.2 — Swarm Health & Telemetry ✅  
**Previous Release:** v0.9.1 (2026-06-22) — Inter-agent communication bus ✅  
**Current Commit:** `eaa92b3` — v1.0 hardening: deny.toml typo fix, docs/guides/verification.md stale counts, CHANGELOG cleanup
**CI Status:** Build & Release #170 ✅ · Container Build #170 ✅ · Security Scan #128 ✅
**v1.0 Hardening Progress:** 14/38 items completed (deprecated types removed, dead code eliminated, library API established, performance targets verified, zero CVEs, API stability, complete docs, reproducible builds, swarm docs fixed, heartbeat docs fixed, telemetry docs fixed, server docs fixed, OTel opt-in, swarm topology alias). **29 new items added** from comprehensive project audit (2026-06-27) + provider strategy (2026-06-28) + rpi5 deployment feedback (2026-06-28): wire unwired infrastructure (`RavenFabricClient`, `ProviderFallbackChain`, `TokenBudget`, `AgentMessageBus`, `SwarmHealthMonitor`, `WebSearchConfig`), fix CLI flags (`--provider anthropic`, `--webhook-port`), fix audit log `unwrap()`, fix README bugs, add missing CLI flags to docs, add community health files, reduce container image size, add server execution endpoints, implement MCP SSE transport, add missing library re-exports, add generic `openai-compatible` provider, ship vLLM docs/tests, ship llama.cpp docs/tests, add Azure OpenAI adapter, add server mode docs page, add deep health check endpoint, add env var for server port.

**Vision:** RavenClaws shall become the ultimate AI agentic assistant and worker —
the supreme, most trusted, and most capable autonomous agent. Simply the best.

RavenClaws operates **autonomously** — with a heartbeat, working on tasks over long
periods independently, without requiring constant human supervision. It plans,
executes, reflects, and adapts across hours, days, or weeks.

RavenClaws orchestrates **swarms at any scale** — from a handful of specialized
collaborators to **thousands of workers**, each with unique traits, capabilities, and
personalities. A swarm is TRULY a swarm: unbounded, self-organizing, and emergent.
RavenClaws provisions, configures, and manages its own sub-agents and worker
instances dynamically based on task requirements — no fixed limit, no artificial
cap. The swarm grows and shrinks organically as work demands.

All of this happens **efficiently and securely** — every agent communication is
policy-gated, audited, and sandboxed. The five pillars (Secure, Small, Efficient,
Robust, Simple) apply to the swarm just as they apply to the single agent.

**Core Principles** — every decision is measured against these five. If a feature
can't be added without breaking one, it doesn't ship in core.

| Pillar | What it means in practice |
|---|---|
| 🔒 **Secure** | Memory-safe Rust (`unsafe` forbidden). Fail-closed. No creds in config, TLS enforced, every tool call policy-gated and audited. Signed releases, SBOM, verified supply chain. |
| 🪶 **Small** | One static binary, distroless image, lean dependency tree. Target < 15 MB stripped, < 30 MB image. |
| ⚡ **Efficient** | Native performance, low idle memory (< 20 MB RSS), fast cold start (< 50 ms), streaming everywhere. |
| 🛡️ **Robust** | No `panic`/`unwrap` on hot paths. Retries with backoff, provider fallback, deterministic config, high coverage. |
| ✨ **Simple** | One command to run. Sensible defaults. Zero-config for common cases. No external services required for single-agent use. |

### Non-goals

- Not a heavyweight orchestration platform — RavenClaws stays a small worker; large-scale mesh coordination is delegated to **RavenFabric**.
- Not a UI/IDE — RavenClaws is a headless binary + library; frontends consume it.
- No telemetry phone-home, ever. Observability is opt-in and self-hosted.

## Competitive Positioning

RavenClaws aims to be the **preferred alternative** to the current field — including
Cognition (Claude), Manus, Perplexity Comet, Kimi, Open Interpreter, and Vellum.

We don't win by out-featuring them. We win by refusing to compromise on all five
pillars at once. By category:

- **vs. cloud / hosted assistants** (Claude Cowork, Manus, Perplexity Computer, Kimi): RavenClaws is **self-hostable, offline-capable, and source-available** under AGPLv3. Your data and tool calls never leave infrastructure you control — no phone-home.
- **vs. minimal agent runtimes** (Open Interpreter, ZeroClaw, PicoClaw): RavenClaws matches their footprint while adding a real **security model** (deny-by-default tool policy, audit log, sandboxing) and **multi-provider** routing with fallback.
- **vs. SDK / platform plays** (Vellum, Hermes Agent): RavenClaws is a **single dependency-light binary**, not a service you rent or a framework you marry. Embed it, ship it, forget it.

The bar: anything the field can do, RavenClaws should do **smaller, safer, and
simpler** — or deliberately not at all.

> **Where RavenClaws must lead, measurably (v1.0):** memory-safe core with zero
> known CVEs, sub-15 MB binary, sub-50 ms cold start, fully self-hostable and
> air-gappable, signed + SBOM-attested supply chain. These are claims we will
> benchmark and publish — not marketing.

### RavenClaws vs. Field (v0.9 achieved)

| Capability | RavenClaws v0.9 | Cognition (Claude) | Manus | Open Interpreter |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Agent loop | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tool calling | ✅ (structured) | ✅ (structured) | ✅ | ✅ |
| **MCP client/server** | ✅ (both) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sandboxed execution | ✅ (wired) | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Optional |
| **Security model** | ✅ (wired) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| **Local-first / air-gapped** | ✅ (Ollama) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **~5 MB binary** | ✅ | ❌ (cloud) | ❌ (cloud) | ❌ (Python) |
| **Helm chart** | ✅ (v0.7.3) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **No telemetry** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Autonomous heartbeat** | ✅ **v0.9** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Long-horizon task persistence** | ✅ **v0.9** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Scalable swarm (1000+ workers)** | ✅ **v0.9** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Self-provisioning sub-agents** | ✅ **v0.9** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Swarm health & telemetry** | ✅ **v0.9.2** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Crate on crates.io** | ✅ **ravenclaws** (binary + library) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Multi-modal input | ⚠️ (partial) | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| Web search | ✅ (SearXNG + DuckDuckGo) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Browser automation | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Plugins |
| Async background runs | ✅ (v0.8) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Scheduling / triggers | ✅ (v0.8) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Sub-agents / swarm | ✅ (v0.6) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| OAuth connectors | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Plugins |

**RavenClaws's Wedge:**
1. **Trust as a feature** — deny-by-default security, no telemetry, verifiable end-to-end
2. **Edge-deployable** — ~5 MB binary, runs on Raspberry Pi, air-gapped capable
3. **RavenFabric mesh** — E2E-encrypted remote execution across fleet (unique)
4. **Autonomous heartbeat** — operates independently for days/weeks, no supervision required ✅ v0.9
5. **Self-orchestrating swarm** — dynamically provisions and manages 10s–1000s of workers in any topology, each with unique capability profiles. No fixed limit — the swarm scales to the task.

## Features Required to Become the Preferred Alternative

Being *preferred* is a two-step bar: first reach **parity** on the capabilities the
field now treats as table stakes, then **win decisively** on the five pillars where
the cloud incumbents structurally can't follow.

### Part 1 — Table stakes (reach parity)

| Capability | Why it's table stakes | In RavenClaws | Target |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|
| Agent loop (plan → act → observe) | Without it there is no "agent" | ✅ | v0.3 |
| Tool / function calling | The substrate for every action | ✅ (primitive) | v0.4 |
| **MCP — client *and* server** | Industry standard (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce) | ✅ (both) | **v0.7** ✅ |
| Sandboxed execution | Native primitive in competitors | ⚠️ (not wired) | v0.4 |
| Persistent memory (vector recall) | Without it every session starts from zero | ⚠️ (in-memory only) | v0.3 → v0.9 |
| Web search + headless browser | Manus/Perplexity center on browse/summarize/fill-forms | ✅ (SearXNG + DuckDuckGo) | **v0.8** ✅ |
| File operations (read/write/edit) | Core to "worker" | ✅ | v0.4 |
| Sub-agents / swarm orchestration | Kimi runs 300 sub-agents / 4,000 steps | ✅ (v0.6) | v0.6 |
| **Autonomous heartbeat (long-running)** | Operates independently for days/weeks without supervision | ✅ **v0.9** | **v0.9** |
| **Scalable swarm (1000+ workers)** | Dynamic provisioning of 10s–1000s of agents in any topology; no fixed limit | ✅ **v0.9** | **v0.9** |
| **Self-provisioning sub-agents** | Agent spawns agents; recursive supervisor mode | ✅ **v0.9** | **v0.9** |
| **Inter-agent communication** | Structured message passing between swarm members | ✅ **v0.9.1** | **v0.9** |
| Async / long-horizon background runs | Manus's killer feature (cloud background) | ✅ **v0.8** | **v0.8** ✅ |
| Scheduling / triggers (cron, webhook) | Proactive, set-and-forget operation | ✅ **v0.8** | **v0.7** |
| Streaming + intermediate results | First-class in Vellum; needed for interactive UX | ✅ | v0.3 |
| Multi-modal input (images, PDFs) | Manus/Kimi are multimodal; "worker" must read docs | ❌ | v0.5 |
| Connectors / integrations (OAuth) | Claude-style connectors; Manus's weakness | ❌ | v0.6 |
| Retries / provider fallback | Vellum: retry, fall back, fail early | ⚠️ (partial) | v0.5 |
| Human-in-the-loop approvals | Enterprises require guardrails + audit + HITL | ✅ **v0.8** | **v0.4** |

### Part 2 — Where RavenClaws wins (the "preferred" wedge)

| Differentiator | Why it beats the field | Pillars | Phase |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|
| **Local-first / self-hosted / air-gapped** | Manus is cloud-only; Comet's "Local" is a browser, not a worker. RavenClaws runs fully offline with Ollama. | Secure · Simple | ✅ core |
| **Security model: deny-by-default + sandbox + audit** | Field bolts security on; we ship it in core. | Secure | ⚠️ v0.4 (wire it) |
| **~5 MB single binary, edge/embeddable** | No cloud agent runs on a Raspberry Pi. | Small · Efficient | ✅ |
| Provider-agnostic + cost-aware routing | Not locked to one model vendor. Generic `openai-compatible` unlocks 10+ backends. | Efficient · Robust | v0.5 → v1.0 |
| **RavenFabric mesh: E2E-encrypted remote exec** | Unique — competitors are single-host or single-cloud. | Robust | ✅ v0.6.1 |
| **No telemetry · signed + SBOM** | Trust as a feature, verifiable end-to-end. | Secure | ✅ |
| **Open core + commercial** | No lock-in, vs. proprietary cloud. | Simple | ✅ |

### Part 3 — The five that move the needle most

1. **MCP client + server (v0.7)** — instant access to entire tool ecosystem. ✅ **Both client and server now implemented.**
2. **Wire security model (v0.4)** — PolicyEngine + Sandbox + AuditLog invoked on every tool call. Core value proposition.
3. **Local-first privacy + security** — the wedge no cloud agent can copy.
4. **Autonomous heartbeat + self-orchestration (v0.9)** — RavenClaws operates independently for days, dynamically spawning and managing swarms of any size. No competitor offers this in a self-hosted, secure package. ✅ **Heartbeat implemented.**
5. **Scalable swarm (1000+ workers) (v0.9)** — from a handful of collaborators to thousands of workers, each with unique profiles. Self-provisioning, self-healing, and policy-governed. No artificial caps — the swarm is a true swarm.

## Phased Plan

Versions are capability milestones, not dates. Each must keep all five pillars green.

### v0.2 — Foundations: make the build honest and green 🔧

- [x] **Commit `Cargo.lock`** (remove from `.gitignore`) so `--locked` works in CI/Docker/publish.
- [x] **Fix multi-arch Docker build** — install cross-linkers (`gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`) + set the cargo target linker.
- [x] **Verify the RavenFabric agent download** against a published checksum / Cosign signature.
- [x] **Single source of version truth** — wire clap `--version` to `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`.
- [x] **Replace `.expect()` on HTTP client construction** with error propagation (no abort path under `panic = "abort"`).
- [x] **Decide `--exec`**: implement one-shot mode (preferred, see v0.3) or remove the flag.
- [x] **Make swarm/supervisor fail loudly** — return a clear error instead of `exit 0` until implemented.
- [x] **Expand tests** — use `mockito` to exercise request/response/error paths for every provider; cover config parsing and the multi-model manager.
- [x] **README status-honesty.**

**Exit criteria:** `cargo fmt && cargo clippy -D warnings && cargo test` green; `docker buildx` produces working `amd64`+`arm64` images; fresh clone builds with `--locked`.

### v0.3 — A real agent 🧠

- [x] **Agent loop**: perceive → plan → act → observe, with max-iteration guard and cancellation.
- [x] **`--exec "<task>"`** one-shot mode — sends prompt to LLM, prints response to stdout.
- [x] **Interactive REPL** (stdin) — continuous conversation mode.
- [x] **Conversation memory** — context across turns; configurable window (last N turns or token budget); session save/restore.
- [x] **Streaming responses** end to end (`stream = true`) across the trait and all clients.
- [x] **System-prompt / persona** configuration.
- [x] **Robust errors** — typed retries, timeouts, graceful provider failure. All error paths covered with `thiserror` + `anyhow`; 26 error tests across 7 variants.

**Exit criteria:** `ravenclaws --exec "summarize this repo"` performs a real multi-step task and returns a result.

### v0.4 — Tools and safety 🧰🔒 **(COMPLETE)**

Agency with guardrails — the security differentiator.

- [x] **Tool / function-calling abstraction** (provider-agnostic schema + registry).
- [x] **Built-in tools**: shell exec, file read/write, web fetch — each behind a capability flag.
- [x] **Tool wiring into agent loop** — `run_agent_loop` detects `TOOL_CALL:` / `ARGS:` patterns, executes tools, injects results as `OBSERVATION:`.
- [x] **Deny-by-default policy** (command / path / host allow-lists), à la RavenFabric's RPCPolicy.
- [x] **Sandboxed execution** (workdir jail, resource limits, timeouts).
- [x] **Audit log** — structured, HMAC-chained, tamper-evident trail of every tool call.
- [x] **Wire security to agent loop** — `PolicyEngine` validates all tool calls; `Sandbox` executes `shell_exec`; `AuditLog` emits events. **COMMIT: 51e42b0**
- [x] **Structured function calling** — OpenAI Tools format for OpenAI/LiteLLM/OpenRouter; native JSON instead of pattern-matching. ✅ v0.4
- [x] **MCP — client** — consume any Model Context Protocol tool/server via stdio transport. ✅ v0.5.2
- [x] **MCP — server** — expose RavenClaws itself as an MCP server over stdio. `--mcp-server` flag, policy-checked and audited. ✅ **v0.7.0**
- [x] **Human-in-the-loop approvals** — configurable approval gates for sensitive tool calls (allow / deny / ask). `--require-approval` flag, `RAVENCLAW_REQUIRE_APPROVAL` env var, prompts via stdin, audited. ✅ **v0.8**
- [x] **Web search + content extraction tool** — SearXNG JSON API + DuckDuckGo HTML backends, HTML-to-text extraction, configurable via `WebSearchConfig`. ✅ **v0.8**
- [x] **Wire `zeroize`** for secret material — API keys in `LLMConfig` and HMAC secret key in `AuditLog` zeroized on drop. ✅ **v0.8**
- [x] **Honor `token_lifetime_secs`** for any issued credentials — agent sessions auto-terminate after configured duration. Enforced in both `run_agent_loop` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp`. ✅ **v0.8**
- [x] **Prompt-injection defense** — instruction-boundary enforcement, output schema validation. ✅ **v0.8**

**Exit criteria:** an agent runs tools, but only those allowed by policy, with a complete audit log. Security features actively invoked, not just present.

### v0.5 — Providers and routing 🔀 **(COMPLETE 2026-06-07)**

**Primary objective:** Eliminate code duplication and add production-grade resilience.

- [x] **Unified OpenAI-Compatible Client** ✅ v0.5.0
  - Merge LiteLLM, OpenAI, OpenRouter into `OpenAICompatibleClient` with provider enum
  - Provider-specific defaults: endpoint, headers (OpenRouter needs `HTTP-Referer`, `X-Title`)
  - Keep Ollama separate (different API format)
  - **Impact:** ~400 LOC reduction, single maintenance path

- [x] **Retry & Fallback Chain** ✅ v0.5.1
  - Exponential backoff with jitter (base 100ms, max 10s, 3 retries)
  - Fallback chain: primary → secondary → tertiary (configurable order)
  - Circuit breaker: open after 5 consecutive failures, half-open after 30s
  - **Exit criteria:** `ravenclaws --exec "task"` with fallback to Ollama when cloud providers fail

- [x] **Token Budget & Cost Tracking** ✅ v0.5.1
  - `--token-budget <N>` CLI flag and `RAVENCLAW_TOKEN_BUDGET` env var
  - Track tokens per request using `usage` field in responses
  - Cost estimation table (per-provider, per-model pricing)
  - Auto-downgrade: switch to cheaper model when 80% of budget consumed
  - **Exit criteria:** Agent stops before exceeding budget, logs cost estimate

- [x] **MCP Client Integration** (highest leverage) ✅ v0.5.2
  - MCP client: connect to external MCP servers (filesystem, database, API tools)
  - Tool discovery and registration from MCP servers
  - Protocol: JSON-RPC over stdio or SSE
  - **Exit criteria:** Can use MCP-provided tools alongside built-in tools

- [x] **Native Anthropic Provider** ✅ v0.5.3
  - Direct Anthropic API client (not via OpenRouter)
  - Support for tool use (Anthropic's native function calling)
  - Image input support (stubbed for future multi-modal expansion)
  - Full test coverage (4 unit tests + integration via factory)

- [ ] **Multi-modal Input** ⚠️ **PARTIAL** — AnthropicClient has image support structure, not wired to CLI *(v0.10)*
  - Image attachments in `ChatMessage` (base64 or URL)
  - PDF/text document ingestion
  - Provider-specific encoding (OpenAI vision, Anthropic images)

**Exit criteria:** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.5 core features)
1. [x] Single run transparently fails over between providers
2. [x] Respects token budget
3. [x] Can consume MCP-provided tools
4. [x] Code coverage ≥80% on routing/fallback logic (277+ tests across 9 modules)

- [x] **Node.js 24 migration** — `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true` in all workflows ✅ Implemented 2026-06-18
- [x] **CodeQL v4 migration** — all `codeql-action/*@v3` → `@v4` ✅ Implemented 2026-06-18
- [x] **RavenFabric integration** — secure E2E remote command execution + mesh coordination (the headline capability). ✅ v0.6.1
- [x] **Agent communication** — structured message passing; conflict resolution across agents. ✅ **v0.9.1** *(moved to v0.9)*
**Exit criteria:** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.6 core features) — Supervisor and Swarm modes implemented for single-provider and multi-model. CI/CD hardened with Node.js 24 and CodeQL v4. RavenFabric integration complete with full client module, wiring into all agent modes, and 12 unit tests.

### v0.7 — Observability and ops 📈 **(COMPLETE)**

- [x] **MCP Server** — expose RavenClaws tools over stdio via MCP protocol. `--mcp-server` flag, policy-checked and audited. ✅ **v0.7.0**
- [x] **Long-running server mode** with HTTP `/health` `/ready` `/metrics` endpoints (fixes the k8s CrashLoop). ✅ **v0.7.1**

- [x] **Eval harness + run inspection** — golden-task evals, assertions on intermediate steps, and replayable run traces. ✅ **v0.7.4**
- [x] **Async / long-horizon background runs** — assign-and-walk-away background execution, resumable across restarts (matches Manus's headline UX). ✅ **v0.8**
- [x] **Scheduling & triggers** — cron, webhook, and file-watch activation for proactive 24/7 agents. ✅ **v0.8**
  - `EvalConfig`/`EvalTask`/`EvalRunner` with 7 assertion types (contains, not_contains, exact, regex, non_empty, min_length, max_length)
  - `RunTrace` with step-by-step, LLM call, and tool call tracing
  - `EvalReport` with text and JSON output formats
  - CLI `--eval <path>` and `--eval-json` flags
  - 24 Rust unit tests + 20 verification tests
  - Sample eval configs in `tests/eval/` (basic-suite.toml, security-suite.toml)

**Exit criteria:** ✅ RavenClaws runs as a stable long-lived workload with green probes, exported metrics, opt-in distributed tracing, and Helm-based deployment.

### v0.8 — Enterprise and compliance 🏢 *(commercial-licensed)*

Maps to the commercial tier in [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).

- [ ] **RBAC + multi-tenant isolation** (separate workspaces, secrets, quotas).
- [ ] **SSO / SAML.**
- [ ] **SecurityPolicy** — immutable rules, blast-radius limits.
- [ ] **Multi-level audit logging** — levels (`off`/`basic`/`detailed`/`debug`), formats (JSON/CEF/LEEF/Syslog), shipping sinks, integrity chaining.
- [ ] **Compliance presets & reporting** (SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS).
- [ ] **Air-gap / offline licensing**; runtime feature-flag gating.
- [ ] **Output artifacts & reporting** — generate documents, spreadsheets, slides, and sites via the skill system (v0.5); underpins compliance and executive reporting.

### ✅ v0.9 — Autonomous heartbeat & self-orchestration 💓 (v0.9.2 released)

RavenClaws becomes a truly autonomous agent that can operate independently over
long time horizons, and dynamically orchestrate swarms of any size.

**Released versions:** [v0.9.0](https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws/releases/tag/v0.9.0) (heartbeat + persistence) · [v0.9.1](https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws/releases/tag/v0.9.1) (swarm orchestration + inter-agent communication) · [v0.9.2](https://github.com/egkristi/RavenClaws/releases/tag/v0.9.2) (swarm health & telemetry)

- [x] **Autonomous heartbeat** — persistent background loop with configurable tick interval; agent wakes, assesses progress, plans next steps, executes, and sleeps. No human-in-the-loop required for routine operation. ✅ **v0.9.0**
- [x] **Long-horizon task persistence** — task state survives restarts; agent resumes from last checkpoint with full context. Heartbeat continues across binary restarts. ✅ **v0.9.0**
  - `HeartbeatState` persisted to `workdir/heartbeat-<id>.json` after every tick
  - `HeartbeatAgent::new()` auto-resumes from saved state on restart
  - `BackgroundTaskManager` persists all tasks as individual JSON files in `<workdir>/tasks/`
  - `--task-resume` flag re-executes incomplete tasks on startup
  - 401 total unit tests (0 regressions)
- [x] **Self-provisioning of sub-agents** — RavenClaws dynamically spawns new agent instances (local or remote via RavenFabric) based on task decomposition. Supervisor mode becomes recursive: supervisors spawn supervisors. ✅ **v0.9.1**
- [x] **Scalable swarm orchestration** — support for 10s to **1000s** of workers. No fixed limit — the swarm scales organically to the task. Configurable topologies: star (single coordinator), mesh (peer-to-peer), hierarchical (tree of supervisors), and hybrid. ✅ **v0.9.1**
- [x] **Worker personality & capability profiles** — each swarm member has a declarative profile (persona, tools, provider, model, resource limits). Profiles are composable and inheritable. ✅ **v0.9.1**
- [x] **Dynamic role assignment** — agent analyzes task requirements and assigns roles (researcher, coder, reviewer, executor) to swarm members based on capability profiles and current load. ✅ **v0.9.1**
- [x] **Inter-agent communication bus** — structured message passing between swarm members with delivery guarantees, routing, and policy enforcement. All communication is audited. ✅ **v0.9.1**
- [x] **Swarm health & telemetry** — heartbeat monitoring per agent, dead-agent detection, automatic replacement. Metrics: task throughput, agent utilization, error rates, communication latency. ✅ **v0.9.2**
  - `SwarmHealthMonitor` with per-worker heartbeat tracking, four-state health model (Healthy/Degraded/Unhealthy/Dead)
  - `WorkerTelemetry` — tasks completed/failed, error count, avg duration, messages sent/received
  - `SwarmMetrics` — aggregate health: total/healthy/degraded/unhealthy/dead workers, task throughput, utilization, error rate, communication latency
  - Configurable heartbeat interval (5s), max missed beats (3), replacement timeout (30s)
  - Integrated into `execute_with_profile()` and `recursive_supervise_impl()` — auto-registration, heartbeat on completion, failure tracking
  - Shared across sub-orchestrators via `Arc<RwLock<>>` for recursive supervision
  - Periodic health check logging in supervisor loop
  - Public accessors: `health_metrics()` and `worker_telemetry()` on `SwarmOrchestrator`
  - CLI flag: `--swarm-health-monitoring` (env: `RAVENCLAW_SWARM_HEALTH_MONITORING`)
  - 22 unit tests, 452 total (0 regressions)

### v0.10 — Hardening, ecosystem, advanced reasoning 💎 *(post-1.0)*

These features are deferred to after the v1.0 stable release. They represent
significant new capabilities that are not required for a production-ready 1.0.

- [ ] **Graceful degradation under load** — when resources are constrained, swarm prioritizes critical tasks, scales down non-essential workers, and queues overflow.
- [ ] **Self-healing** — failed agents are detected, replaced, and caught up. Supervisor re-assigns orphaned tasks. No single point of failure in mesh topologies.
- [ ] **Threat model + external security review.**
- [ ] **Fuzzing** (`cargo fuzz`) + property tests for config/policy parsers.
- [ ] **Skill/plugin marketplace + WASM sandboxing** for third-party extensions (core MCP ships in v0.4, the skill system in v0.5).
- [ ] **SDKs** (Python/TS) and a documentation site.
- [ ] **Advanced reasoning** — tree-of-thought, self-reflection, uncertainty estimation / ask-for-help.
- [ ] **Memory tiers** — episodic, semantic (local embeddings), procedural.
- [ ] **Config hot-reload** — Changes to `ravenclaws.toml` should be picked up without restart.
- [ ] **Agent execution endpoints in server mode** — `/chat`, `/execute`, `/tools` endpoints so the HTTP server can actually run agents, not just report status.
- [ ] **Eval harness integration with agent loop** — `EvalRunner::run_task()` should use `run_agent_loop()` instead of calling `llm.chat()` directly, so eval tasks test tool calling, ReAct loop, and security integration.
- [ ] **Tool call assertions in eval harness** — Add assertion types for checking tool calls were made, specific tools were invoked, and tool results were processed.
- [ ] **Deduplicate `run_agent_loop` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp`** — ~500 lines of duplicated code. Refactor to share common logic with MCP tool registration as a plugin.
- [ ] **Multi-modal input** — Wire AnthropicClient's image support structure to CLI. Image attachments in `ChatMessage` (base64 or URL), PDF/text document ingestion.
- [ ] **Connectors / integrations** — OAuth connectors for Google Drive, M365, Slack, GitHub, Notion.
- [ ] **Skill / Plugin System** — Portable capability bundles: `skill.yaml` + scripts + resources, progressive disclosure, sandboxed skill execution.

### v1.0 — Simply the best 🏆

The stable release. RavenClaws is production-ready, benchmarked, documented, and
trusted. All five pillars are verified by independent measurement.

**Scope:** v1.0 = current v0.9.2 + hardening + docs + API stability + provider
strategy (generic `openai-compatible`, vLLM/llama.cpp recipes, Azure adapter) +
rpi5 deployment fixes (swarm/heartbeat/telemetry/server docs accuracy, OTel opt-in,
deep health check, server port env var, heartbeat state on shutdown).
Enterprise features (v0.8) and advanced capabilities (v0.10) are deferred to post-1.0.

- [x] **Deprecated types removed** — `LiteLLMClient`, `OpenRouterClient`, `OpenAIClient` (deprecated since v0.5.0) removed from codebase.
- [x] **Dead code eliminated** — legacy `execute_tool_call`, unused `run_exec_stream`, and `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations reviewed and cleaned up.
- [x] **Library API established** — `[lib]` section in `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs` with re-exports of stable public API for all 18 modules.
- [x] **Performance targets verified** — 5.2 MB stripped binary (< 15 MB target ✅), 5.2 ms cold start (< 50 ms target ✅). Both well under v1.0 targets.
- [x] **Zero known CVEs** — cargo-audit confirms 0 CVEs in dependency tree. 1 advisory (unmaintained `instant` transitive dep through `notify`) — informational only, no fix available.
- [x] **API stability** guarantees + semver discipline. All public enums and structs reviewed: `#[non_exhaustive]` added to `RavenClawsError`, `ConfigError`, `LLMError`, `ToolError`, `LLMProvider`, `OpenAICompatibleProvider`, `CircuitState`, `ToolCategory`, `Config`, `LLMConfig`, `SecurityConfig`, `RuntimeConfig`, `RavenFabricConfig`, `TelemetryConfig`, `SchedulerConfig`, `WebSearchConfig`. Doc comments added to all public types.
- [ ] **Autonomous operation validated** — RavenClaws runs unattended for 7+ days, completing tasks via heartbeat loop, recovering from failures, and scaling swarm up/down as needed.
- [ ] **Swarm scale validated** — 1000+ worker agents operating in mesh topology, with < 5% overhead per additional agent. Swarm grows and shrinks organically — no fixed limit, no artificial cap.
- [x] **Complete docs**, examples, migration guides. README includes quickstart, library usage guide, configuration reference, and architecture overview. — `docs/guides/` (getting-started, configuration, swarm-mode, mcp-integration, heartbeat-mode, migration), `examples/` (basic_chat, agent_loop, swarm, mcp_client, heartbeat), README with FAQ and doc links.
- [ ] **All verification tests passing** across all 4 deployment targets (macOS, Linux, Docker, K8s).
- [ ] **Release automation complete** — signed tags, multi-arch containers, SBOM, provenance, crates.io publish all green. (CI pipeline fully wired; needs tag-push verification.)
- [x] **Reproducible builds** — `Cargo.lock` committed, `lto=true` + `codegen-units=1` in release profile, Docker base images pinned to specific digests, `Cargo.toml` includes `exclude` for crate size optimization.
- [ ] **Wire `RavenFabricClient` into agent loop** — client is created in `main.rs` but `health()`, `list_agents()`, `execute()`, and `broadcast()` are never invoked at runtime. All methods are `#[allow(dead_code)]`.
- [ ] **Wire `ProviderFallbackChain` into agent loop** — fallback chain struct and all methods are `#[allow(dead_code)]`. Never used by `run_agent_loop` or `run_agent_loop_with_mcp`.
- [ ] **Wire `TokenBudget` into agent loop** — entire struct and all methods are `#[allow(dead_code)]`. Token budget is never checked during agent execution.
- [ ] **Wire `AgentMessageBus` into swarm orchestration** — message bus is created but never used in the orchestration flow. All methods are `#[allow(dead_code)]`.
- [ ] **Wire `SwarmHealthMonitor` into swarm orchestration** — health monitoring is initialized but never checked during orchestration. All methods are `#[allow(dead_code)]`.
- [ ] **Wire `WebSearchConfig` into web search tool** — web search tool uses hardcoded SearXNG endpoint (`https://searx.be`). The `Config.web_search` field and `WebSearchConfig` struct are `#[allow(dead_code)]`.
- [ ] **Fix `--provider anthropic` CLI flag** — Anthropic provider is unreachable via CLI. The `--provider` flag maps `"openrouter"`, `"ollama"`, `"openai"` but `"anthropic"` falls through to default `LiteLLM`. The `Anthropic` variant exists in `LLMProvider` enum and `create_client()` supports it, but the CLI can't select it.
- [ ] **Fix `--webhook-port` CLI flag** — `webhook_port` CLI flag is parsed in `main.rs` but never used. The scheduler's webhook server hardcodes port `9090` instead of using the parsed value.
- [ ] **Replace `unwrap()` on audit log mutex** — 7+ `unwrap()` calls on `self.entries.lock()` in `audit.rs` (lines 181, 315, 320, 325, 330, 361, 367). If the mutex is poisoned, the entire audit log panics. This is a hot path — every tool call, policy decision, and approval goes through these locks.
- [ ] **Fix README env var prefix** — README uses `RAVENCLAW__` (missing the final S) instead of `RAVENCLAWS__` in Quick Start, Docker, and env var table sections. This would cause config loading to fail for users following the README literally.
- [ ] **Fix README `--mode single` reference** — Quick Start shows `./target/release/ravenclaws --mode single` which is not the recommended usage pattern. Should use `--exec` or `--repl`.
- [ ] **Add missing CLI flags to configuration docs** — `--mcp-client`, `--swarm`, `--supervisor`, `--heartbeat` flags exist in the binary but are not listed in the CLI flags table in `docs/guides/configuration.md` or `website/public/docs/configuration.html`.
- [ ] **Add v0.9.1 → v0.9.2 migration section to `docs/guides/migration.md`** — No documentation for the inter-agent communication bus (`AgentMessageBus`, `MessageType`) and swarm health monitoring (`SwarmHealthMonitor`, `WorkerHealthStatus`) additions.
- [ ] **Add community health files** — Missing `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, `FUNDING.yml`, issue templates, and PR template. These are required for OSS project maturity and GitHub community profile.
- [ ] **Reduce container image size** — Current ~50 MB vs < 30 MB target. Investigate multi-stage build optimization, smaller base image, or removing RavenFabric agent binary from production image.
- [ ] **Add agent execution endpoints to HTTP server** — Server mode has `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics` but no `/chat`, `/execute`, or `/tools` endpoints. The server can report status but cannot actually run agents.
- [ ] **Implement SSE transport for MCP** — `McpTransportConfig::Sse` variant exists but returns `"SSE transport not yet implemented"`. This is the only `TODO` in the entire codebase.
- [ ] **Add missing re-exports to library crate** — `heartbeat`, `swarm`, `background`, `scheduler`, `server`, `mcp`, `eval`, `telemetry`, `ravenfabric` modules are not re-exported from `src/lib.rs`. Library users cannot easily access `HeartbeatAgent`, `SwarmOrchestrator`, `BackgroundTaskManager`, `Scheduler`, `McpClient`, `McpServer`, `EvalRunner`, `TelemetryGuard`, or `RavenFabricClient` without deep path imports.
- [ ] **Add generic `provider = "openai-compatible"` variant** — Unlocks vLLM, llama.cpp, LM Studio, TGI, Groq, Together AI, Fireworks, DeepInfra, and any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint. ~160 LOC: enum variant in `config.rs`, CLI mapping in `main.rs`, 3-4 `mockito` tests.
- [ ] **Ship vLLM docs + verification tests** — `docs/guides/vllm.md` with quick start, `scripts/lib/test-provider-vllm.sh` for integration testing, matching `website/public/docs/vllm.html` page.
- [ ] **Ship llama.cpp docs + verification tests** — `docs/guides/llamacpp.md` with quick start, `scripts/lib/test-provider-llamacpp.sh` for integration testing, matching `website/public/docs/llamacpp.html` page.
- [ ] **Add Azure OpenAI adapter** — `Azure` variant to `OpenAICompatibleProvider` with `api-key` header, deployment-based URLs, and `api-version` query parameter. ~240 LOC.
- [x] **Fix swarm docs: `"flat"` → `"star"`** — Added `#[serde(alias = "flat")]` to `SwarmTopology::Star`. Updated all docs to use `"star"` and correct `[[swarm.profiles]]` array-of-tables syntax. Fixed `agent_count` → `max_workers`.
- [x] **Fix heartbeat docs: wrong field names, missing `goal`** — Updated all docs to use correct field names (`tick_interval_secs`, `max_ticks`, `workdir`) and added missing `goal` (required), `max_iterations_per_tick`, `enable_tools`.
- [x] **Fix telemetry docs: wrong field names** — Updated docs to use `otel_disabled` (not `enabled`), `otel_endpoint` (not `endpoint`), `otel_service_name`. Removed non-existent `exporter` field.
- [x] **Fix server docs: remove `enable_metrics`** — Removed `enable_metrics` from docs. The `/metrics` endpoint is always served unconditionally.
- [x] **Make OpenTelemetry opt-in by default** — Changed `otel_disabled` default from `false` to `true`. OTel is now disabled by default, eliminating the confusing startup warning.
- [ ] **Add dedicated HTTP server mode docs page** — `docs/guides/server-mode.md` and `website/public/docs/server-mode.html` explaining endpoints, configuration, ingress setup, and interaction with heartbeat mode.
- [ ] **Add deep health check endpoint** — `/health/deep` that verifies LLM connectivity by making a lightweight request, in addition to the existing process-liveness `/health`.
- [ ] **Add env var override for server port** — Document `RAVENCLAWS_RUNTIME_PORT` or add `RAVENCLAWS_SERVE_PORT` as an env var alias for the server port.
- [ ] **Improve heartbeat `goal` error message** — When `heartbeat.goal` is missing, include an example in the error message: `missing configuration field "heartbeat.goal" — set a goal string describing the agent's autonomous purpose (e.g., goal = "Monitor system health and report anomalies")`.
- [ ] **Save heartbeat state on graceful shutdown** — Add a `Drop` impl or shutdown hook to `HeartbeatAgent` that calls `persist_state()` when the agent loop exits on SIGTERM/SIGINT.

**Exit criteria:** All checkboxes above checked. No critical or high issues in ISSUES.md. CI/CD green across all 3 workflows. v1.0 tag pushed and released.

## Provider Strategy

### Current Architecture

RavenClaws has **5 native LLM providers** unified under `LLMProviderTrait`:

| Provider | Client | Status |
|---|---|---|
| LiteLLM | `OpenAICompatibleClient` (variant: `LiteLLM`) | ✅ Working |
| OpenAI | `OpenAICompatibleClient` (variant: `OpenAI`) | ✅ Working |
| OpenRouter | `OpenAICompatibleClient` (variant: `OpenRouter`) | ✅ Working |
| Ollama | `OpenAICompatibleClient` (variant: `Ollama`) | ✅ Working |
| Anthropic | `AnthropicClient` (native, not OpenAI-compat) | ✅ Working |

The `OpenAICompatibleClient` handles 4 of 5 providers via a shared `/v1/chat/completions`
endpoint with provider-specific defaults (endpoint URL, headers, model names).

### Recommendation: Add a Generic `openai-compatible` Provider

**Decision: ADD a generic `provider = "openai-compatible"` variant.** This is the
single highest-leverage provider addition — it unlocks dozens of inference engines
with zero per-provider code.

**What it covers (all speak `/v1/chat/completions`):**
- **vLLM** — popular open-source inference engine (PagedAttention, continuous batching)
- **llama.cpp** / **llamafile** — local CPU/GPU inference, single-binary server
- **LM Studio** — GUI + local server for GGUF models
- **Text Generation Inference (TGI)** — Hugging Face's inference server
- **Groq** — ultra-fast LPU inference (free tier available)
- **Together AI** — hosted open-source models
- **Fireworks AI** — fast inference, function-calling support
- **DeepInfra** — serverless inference
- **Perplexity** — API-compatible endpoint
- **Any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint** — self-hosted, air-gapped, or proprietary

**Implementation scope (small):**
1. Add `OpenAICompatible` variant to `OpenAICompatibleProvider` enum in `config.rs`
2. No new client code — `OpenAICompatibleClient` already speaks the right protocol
3. Provider defaults: no default endpoint (user must set `--endpoint`), no default API key
4. CLI mapping: `--provider openai-compatible` (hyphenated for readability)
5. Tool-calling: depends on the backend — vLLM supports tools, llama.cpp does not (yet)
6. Tests: 3-4 `mockito` tests verifying custom endpoint + no-default-key behavior

**Estimated effort:** ~50 LOC in `config.rs` + ~30 LOC in `main.rs` + ~80 LOC tests = **~160 LOC total**

**Why NOT add native vLLM / llama.cpp providers:**
- Both speak OpenAI-compatible API — a native client would be a wrapper around the same
  `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with no additional capability
- Adding them as named variants creates maintenance burden (version bumps, endpoint changes)
- The generic approach is more future-proof — adding a new inference engine doesn't require a code change

### Recommendation: Ship Tested Docs/Recipes

**Decision: ADD configuration recipes + verification tests for vLLM and llama.cpp.**
Documentation is where the real value lives — users need to know how to point RavenClaws
at these backends, not that a new enum variant exists.

**What to ship:**
1. **`docs/guides/vllm.md`** — Quick start: `docker run vllm/vllm-openai:latest --model mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3` → `ravenclaws --provider openai-compatible --endpoint http://localhost:8000 --model mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3`
2. **`docs/guides/llamacpp.md`** — Quick start: `llama-server -m model.gguf --port 8080` → `ravenclaws --provider openai-compatible --endpoint http://localhost:8080 --model model`
3. **Verification tests** in `scripts/lib/test-provider-vllm.sh` and `scripts/lib/test-provider-llamacpp.sh` — start the backend, run a test prompt, verify response, stop the backend
4. **Add to `scripts/verify.sh`** — `--vllm` and `--llamacpp` flags (skipped if backends not available)
5. **Add to `website/public/docs/`** — matching HTML pages for ravenclaws.io

**Estimated effort:** ~200 LOC docs + ~100 LOC verification tests + ~50 LOC website = **~350 LOC total**

### Recommendation: Add a Small Azure OpenAI Adapter

**Decision: ADD an `Azure` variant to `OpenAICompatibleProvider`.** Azure OpenAI uses
the same `/v1/chat/completions` protocol but differs in three ways:
1. **API key header:** `api-key` instead of `Authorization: Bearer`
2. **Endpoint format:** `https://{resource}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deployment}/chat/completions?api-version={version}`
3. **Model name:** deployment name, not model name

**Implementation scope (small):**
1. Add `Azure` variant to `OpenAICompatibleProvider` enum
2. Override `build_headers()` to use `api-key` header
3. Override `build_endpoint()` to construct the Azure-specific URL
4. Config fields: `--endpoint` (resource base URL), `--azure-deployment`, `--azure-api-version`
5. Tests: 3-4 `mockito` tests for header format, URL construction, and error handling

**Estimated effort:** ~80 LOC in `config.rs` + ~60 LOC in `llm.rs` + ~100 LOC tests = **~240 LOC total**

### Recommendation: Defer Native AWS Bedrock and Gemini/Vertex

**Decision: DO NOT add native Bedrock or Gemini/Vertex providers at this time.**

| Provider | Why defer | How to reach today |
|---|---|---|
| **AWS Bedrock** | Complex auth (AWS SigV4), separate SDK, low community demand for self-hosted agents | Via LiteLLM proxy (`litellm --model bedrock/*`) |
| **Gemini / Vertex AI** | OpenAI-compatibility layer exists (`gemini-2.0-flash` works via OpenRouter); Vertex has complex GCP auth | Via OpenRouter or LiteLLM proxy |
| **Mistral AI** | OpenAI-compatible API | Via `openai-compatible` generic provider |
| **Cohere** | OpenAI-compatible API | Via `openai-compatible` generic provider |
| **xAI (Grok)** | OpenAI-compatible API | Via `openai-compatible` generic provider |

**Rationale:**
- All four are reachable today via LiteLLM or OpenRouter — no capability gap
- Adding native providers creates maintenance burden (API changes, auth complexity, SDK updates)
- The generic `openai-compatible` provider covers Mistral, Cohere, and xAI with zero code
- Bedrock and Gemini/Vertex have complex auth that would require significant code (~500+ LOC each)
- This aligns with the **Small** and **Simple** pillars — resist adding code that LiteLLM already handles

### Critical Caveat: Tool-Calling Fidelity is the Gating Feature

**Tool-calling (function calling) is NOT guaranteed across OpenAI-compatible backends.**
Chat completion works everywhere, but structured tool calling varies wildly:

| Backend | Tool Calling | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | ✅ Full | Native, reliable |
| Anthropic | ✅ Full | Native (separate client) |
| LiteLLM | ✅ Full | Proxies to any backend |
| vLLM | ⚠️ Partial | Supports tools format, quality varies by model |
| llama.cpp | ❌ None | No tool-calling support (GGUF format limitation) |
| Groq | ✅ Good | Fast, supports tools |
| Together AI | ✅ Good | Supports tools |
| TGI | ⚠️ Partial | Limited tool support |
| Ollama | ⚠️ Partial | Tool support varies by model |

**Impact on agent loop:** If the backend doesn't support tool calling, the agent loop
falls back to ReAct-style text parsing (`TOOL_CALL:` / `ARGS:` patterns). This works
but is less reliable than structured function calling.

**Recommendation:** Document tool-calling support per backend in the recipe docs.
The agent loop already handles both modes (structured + text-based), so no code change
is needed — just clear documentation of what works where.

### Summary: Provider Roadmap

| Action | Priority | Effort | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Add `provider = "openai-compatible"` generic variant | **High** | ~160 LOC | Unlocks 10+ inference engines |
| Ship vLLM docs + verification tests | **High** | ~350 LOC | Production-grade local inference |
| Ship llama.cpp docs + verification tests | **Medium** | ~350 LOC | Edge/air-gapped inference |
| Add Azure OpenAI adapter | **Medium** | ~240 LOC | Enterprise Azure customers |
| Native AWS Bedrock provider | **Defer** | ~500+ LOC | Reachable via LiteLLM |
| Native Gemini/Vertex provider | **Defer** | ~500+ LOC | Reachable via OpenRouter/LiteLLM |
| Native Mistral/Cohere/xAI provider | **Defer** | ~0 LOC | Covered by generic `openai-compatible` |

**Total v1.0 provider scope:** ~1,100 LOC (generic provider + vLLM docs + llama.cpp docs + Azure adapter)
**Post-v1.0:** Revisit Bedrock/Gemini if LiteLLM proxy is insufficient for production deployments.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit:** every module; provider request/response/error paths via `mockito`.
- **Integration:** end-to-end agent runs against a stubbed provider and a local Ollama.
- **Policy/security:** table-driven allow/deny tests; fuzzing on policy + config parsing.
- **CI gates:** `fmt`, `clippy -D warnings`, `test`, Trivy (CRITICAL/HIGH fail), SBOM per release.
- **Coverage goal:** ≥ 80% line coverage by v1.0; no `unwrap`/`expect` on non-test hot paths.

**Current coverage:** 452 unit tests across 18 modules + 114 verification tests across 10 modules. All tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean.

**Known testing gaps:**
- `EvalRunner::run_task()` calls `llm.chat()` directly — does NOT use `run_agent_loop()`. Eval tasks don't test tool calling, ReAct loop, or security integration.
- No tool call assertions in eval harness — `Assertion` enum has 7 text-based types but no assertion for checking tool calls were made or specific tools were invoked.
- `run_agent_loop` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp` have ~500 lines of duplicated code — no shared test coverage for the common logic.
- No integration tests for `RavenFabricClient` execution paths (client is created but never called).
- No integration tests for `ProviderFallbackChain` or `TokenBudget` (both are dead code).
- No integration tests for `AgentMessageBus` or `SwarmHealthMonitor` (both are dead code in orchestration).

## Security Hardening (by version)

| Version | Hardening added |
|---|---|
| 0.1 | Memory-safe Rust, TLS check, no creds in config, distroless, signed images, SBOM, Trivy. |
| 0.2 | Verified supply chain for downloaded binaries (SHA256 checksum); no panic/abort on client init; cross-compilation deps in CI. |
| 0.4 | Deny-by-default tool policy, sandboxed execution, audit log, secret zeroization, prompt-injection defense. **(Infrastructure complete, needs wiring)** |
| 0.8 | Secret zeroization on drop (`zeroize` for API keys + HMAC keys), `atty` replaced with `std::io::IsTerminal`. |
| 0.6 | E2E-encrypted remote exec via RavenFabric. |
| 0.7 | MCP Server — policy-checked and audited tool exposure over stdio. HTTP server mode with health/metrics endpoints. OpenTelemetry tracing. Helm chart for K8s deployment. |
| 0.8 | RBAC, SecurityPolicy with blast-radius limits, compliance reporting. |
| 0.9 | Inter-agent communication encryption, swarm-wide policy enforcement, heartbeat authentication, self-provisioning authorization. |
| 0.10 | External security review, fuzzing, published threat model. |
| 1.0 | Audit log mutex `unwrap()` → proper error handling. Community health files (SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md). SSE transport for MCP. |

## Design Decisions

- **Rust, `unsafe` forbidden** — memory safety and small static binaries are foundational to "secure + small."
- **OpenAI-compatible core** — most providers speak it; one client shape covers LiteLLM/OpenAI/OpenRouter, with Ollama as the documented exception.
- **AGPLv3 + Commercial dual license** — keeps the core open, closes the SaaS loophole, funds development. See [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).
- **Delegate heavy orchestration to RavenFabric** — RavenClaws stays a small worker; the mesh/remote-exec substrate is a separate, specialized system.
- **No phone-home** — observability is opt-in and self-hosted; trust is a feature.

## Technical Debt

Concrete items carried from the current codebase:

1. ~~**Security infrastructure not wired** — `PolicyEngine`, `Sandbox`, `AuditLog` are complete but never invoked.~~ ✅ **Wired to agent loop (commit 51e42b0)**
2. ~~**Pattern-matching tool calls** — Fragile `TOOL_CALL:` / `ARGS:` parsing instead of structured JSON.~~ ✅ **Structured function calling (v0.4)**
3. ~~**No MCP integration** — Reinventing tools instead of using industry standard.~~ ✅ **MCP client (v0.5.2)**
4. ~~**k8s Deployment runs a program that exits immediately** → needs server mode (v0.7) or a Job manifest meanwhile.~~ ✅ **Fixed — `--serve` mode with HTTP probes**
5. ~~**Client duplication** across LiteLLM/OpenAI/OpenRouter (`handle_response` ×4).~~ ✅ **Unified `OpenAICompatibleClient` (v0.5.0)**
6. ~~**Dead/unwired code:** `rustls` dep unused; `security`/`ravenfabric` config fields not honored.~~ ✅ **All modules wired to agent loop; RavenFabric config fields consumed by client; `zeroize` wired for secret material**
7. ~~**No graceful shutdown** — SIGTERM/SIGINT not handled; no audit log flush on exit.~~ ✅ **Fixed — graceful shutdown in server mode (v0.7.1)**
8. **No config hot-reload** — Changes require restart.
9. **Container image ~50 MB** — Target is < 30 MB.
10. **cargo-udeps findings** — Unused dependencies detected. *(periodic review)*
11. **cargo-outdated findings** — Dependencies behind latest. *(periodic review)*
12. **~60 `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations** — Significant unwired infrastructure: `RavenFabricClient`, `ProviderFallbackChain`, `TokenBudget`, `AgentMessageBus`, `SwarmHealthMonitor`, `WebSearchConfig`, and ~15 unused error variants, ~15 unused struct fields, ~15 unused methods, ~5 dead error enums.
13. **`unwrap()` on audit log mutex** — 7+ calls on hot path (`audit.rs` lines 181, 315, 320, 325, 330, 361, 367). Will panic if mutex is poisoned.
14. **`run_agent_loop` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp` are nearly identical** — ~500 lines of duplicated code. The only difference is MCP tool registration.
15. **Legacy `TOOL_CALL:` / `ARGS:` format still supported** — Dead code path in agent loop. No LLM provider generates this format.
16. **`EvalRunner::run_task()` bypasses agent loop** — Calls `llm.chat()` directly instead of `run_agent_loop()`. Eval tasks don't test tool calling, ReAct loop, or security integration.
17. **No tool call assertions in eval harness** — `Assertion` enum has 7 text-based types but no assertion for checking tool calls were made or specific tools were invoked.
18. **Server mode has no agent execution endpoints** — Only `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics`. No `/chat`, `/execute`, or `/tools`.
