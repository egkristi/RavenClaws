# 🐦‍⬛ RavenClaws Roadmap

> **Strategic Directive (2026-08-13 re-analysis):** RavenClaws must be able to do
> anything **OpenClaw, NanoClaw, ZeroClaw, OpenFang, nanobot, ironclaw, and Claude
> Cowork** can do — and just do it better. The fastest path is to lift the working
> Rust reference implementations already present in the sibling project
> **RavenAssistant01** (see "v0.11 — Universal Parity: The Merge Phase" below and
> `RAVENCLAWS-MERGE.md` / `RAVENCLAWS-IMPROVEMENTS.md`).

**Date:** 2026-07-02 *(re-analyzed 2026-08-13)*  
**Version:** v1.6.0 — Universal Parity + Hardening + UIs + Providers 🐦‍⬛  
**Previous Release:** v1.3.0 (2026-07-02) — Advanced Reasoning  
**Current Commit:** (v1.6.0 — TUI + GUI + vLLM/SGLang + cost tracking)
**CI Status:** Build & Release ✅ · Container Build ✅ · Security Scan ✅
**Test Count:** 587 unit tests · 114 verification tests · 0 failures
**v1.0 Hardening Progress:** v0.9.4–v0.9.16 all complete ✅. **v0.9.14 closed ALL remaining metrics and polish gaps** — token tracking, tool calls counter, `/ready` caching, MCP params optionality, RavenFabric pipe policy, `--eval /dev/null` handling, `imagePullPolicy` verification. **v0.9.15 closed ALL ecosystem expansion gaps** — vLLM docs + verification tests, llama.cpp docs + verification tests, distroless HTTP testing docs, website docs pages for both providers. **v0.9.16 closed the last v1.0 blocker** — SSE MCP ecosystem verification: `--mcp-sse-server` CLI flag wired, SSE transport for MCP client config, MCP integration tests (stdio + SSE), SSE transport documentation. All gaps identified in v0.9.11 rpi5 deployment feedback are now closed. **v1.0 is released — the stable release. All exit criteria are met.** **v1.0.1 fixes the 4 remaining critical rpi5 issues: `/tools/{name}` 404, RavenFabric URL builder, `/execute` empty result, and distroless SIGHUP — all resolved.** **v1.0.1 also adds WASM plugin system (Plugin ABI v1, 11 unit tests) and SQLite conversation persistence (15 unit tests) — 485 total unit tests across 20 modules.**

**Strategic Positioning:** RavenClaws is the **"Temporal for AI agents"** — the lightweight, durable execution engine for AI agents. Unlike LangGraph (complex graphs), Temporal (heavy infra), or CrewAI (Python-only), RavenClaws gives you reliable, checkpointed agent execution in a ~5 MB binary that runs on a Raspberry Pi. **Durable execution (checkpoint/resume) is implemented in v0.9.12** — agent loop saves state after each iteration and survives process restarts. **Multi-agent patterns (debate, review-loop, research-synthesize, voting) are implemented in v0.9.13.** **Production stability verified in v0.9.11 rpi5 audit: 3,597 requests, 0 errors, 10 Mi RSS, 0 restarts over 7.5 hours.**

**Key messaging:**
- "Your agents survive crashes" — durable execution means no lost work ✅ **v0.9.12**
- "Multi-agent patterns out of the box" — debate, review, research, voting as built-in primitives ✅ **v0.9.13**
- "Production-proven on Raspberry Pi" — 3,597 requests, 0 errors, 10 Mi RSS ✅ **v0.9.11 audit**
- "Edge-native" — runs on RPi5, IoT, containers, anywhere with 3MiB RAM
- "Rust-safety" — compile-time guarantees, no runtime errors
- "Open-source, self-hosted" — no vendor lock-in, no per-seat pricing

RavenClaws operates **autonomously** — with a heartbeat, working on tasks over long
periods independently, without requiring constant human supervision. It plans,
executes, reflects, and adapts across hours, days, or weeks.

RavenClaws orchestrates **swarms at any scale** — from a handful of specialized
collaborators to **thousands of workers**, each with unique traits, capabilities, and
personalities. A swarm is TRULY a swarm: unbounded, self-organizing, and emergent.
RavenClaws provisions, configures, and manages its own sub-agents and worker
instances dynamically based on task requirements — no fixed limit, no artificial
cap. The swarm grows and shrinks organically as work demands.

All of this happens **efficiently and securely** — every agent communication is
policy-gated, audited, and sandboxed. The five pillars (Secure, Small, Efficient,
Robust, Simple) apply to the swarm just as they apply to the single agent.

### The rpi5 Verdict — and Our Response

Real-world testing on a Raspberry Pi 5 (K3s, aarch64, 8GB RAM) revealed that RavenClaws
v0.9.3 was **functional but not yet a primary agent**. The feedback was honest:

> *"RavenClaws works as a lightweight, secure agent runtime — it runs, connects to LLMs,
> executes agent loops, and manages swarms. But it's not a drop-in replacement for OpenClaw."*

**By v0.9.8, all 13 resolved issues from feedback are confirmed working.**
**10 critical bugs fixed. 4 documentation gaps closed. 4 feature requests documented.**
**7 production hardening items deferred to v0.9.9 (community health files, container image size, init container chown, graceful shutdown for heartbeat/all modes, NetworkPolicy docs, Secret reference docs, migration docs).**
**RavenClaws runs successfully on Raspberry Pi 5 (aarch64, 8GB RAM, K3s) with ~3 MiB RSS
idle memory, ~1m CPU idle, <1s startup, and ~50 MB container image — 265x less memory
and 228x less CPU than OpenClaw.**

**The remaining gaps are now strategic, not tactical.** The feedback's deep analysis
identified three game-changing features (Tier 1) that would make RavenClaws uniquely
valuable, not just "good enough." These are now the focus of v0.9.9+, alongside the
7 production hardening items deferred from v0.9.8.

**The strategic insight from the feedback:**
> *"RavenClaws should be the 'Temporal for AI agents' — durable execution, multi-agent
> orchestration, and edge-native deployment, all in a 15.8MB image. Not a general-purpose
> agent framework, but the reliable infrastructure layer that other frameworks build on."*

**The three game-changing features that make this real:**
1. **Durable execution** (checkpoint/resume) — the Temporal killer for agents
2. **SSE MCP transport** — unlocks the entire MCP ecosystem
3. **Multi-agent patterns as primitives** — debate, review-loop, research-synthesize shipped in the box

These three features, combined with RavenClaws' existing strengths (15.8MB, 3MiB RAM,
distroless, Rust-safety), would make it the **most compelling agent framework for
production deployments** — especially on constrained hardware.

**The plan:** Six rapid releases (v0.9.4 → v0.9.9) closed every gap identified in
rpi5 deployment feedback. v0.9.10 closed all production hardening gaps. v0.9.11
delivered strategic features (dedup, Azure, eval integration). v0.9.12 delivered
durable execution (checkpoint/resume). v0.9.13 delivered multi-agent patterns.
**v0.9.14 closed all remaining metrics and polish gaps** ✅ — token tracking,
tool call counting, `/ready` caching, MCP server `params` optionality, RavenFabric
pipe policy, empty eval config validation, and `imagePullPolicy` verification.
**v0.9.15+ shifts to ecosystem expansion** — vLLM/llama.cpp docs, SSE MCP ecosystem
verification, and the remaining items before v1.0. After that, v1.0 is truly
production-ready — a primary agent that can replace OpenClaw, Manus, or any cloud
agent, while being smaller, more secure, and more efficient.

**Strategic shift (v0.9.9+):** The feedback's deep analysis revealed that RavenClaws
should not just catch up to competitors — it should lead in three areas where no
other framework excels:
1. **Durable execution** (checkpoint/resume) — the #1 gap across ALL agent frameworks ✅ **v0.9.12**
2. **Multi-agent patterns as built-in primitives** — debate, review-loop, research-synthesize ✅ **v0.9.13**
3. **Edge-native deployment** — already winning, make it undeniable ✅ **v0.9.11 audit confirms: 10 Mi RSS, 0 errors, 3,597 requests**

These three features, combined with RavenClaws' existing strengths, make the
"Temporal for AI agents" positioning real. **All three game-changing features are now implemented.**

**Core Principles** — every decision is measured against these five. If a feature
can't be added without breaking one, it doesn't ship in core.

| Pillar | What it means in practice |
|---|---|
| 🔒 **Secure** | Memory-safe Rust (`unsafe` forbidden). Fail-closed. No creds in config, TLS enforced, every tool call policy-gated and audited. Signed releases, SBOM, verified supply chain. |
| 🪶 **Small** | One static binary, distroless image, lean dependency tree. Target < 15 MB stripped, < 30 MB image. |
| ⚡ **Efficient** | Native performance, low idle memory (< 20 MB RSS), fast cold start (< 50 ms), streaming everywhere. |
| 🛡️ **Robust** | No `panic`/`unwrap` on hot paths. Retries with backoff, provider fallback, deterministic config, high coverage. |
| ✨ **Simple** | One command to run. Sensible defaults. Zero-config for common cases. No external services required for single-agent use. |

### Non-goals

- Not a heavyweight orchestration platform — RavenClaws stays a small worker; large-scale mesh coordination is delegated to **RavenFabric**.
- Not a UI/IDE — RavenClaws is a headless binary + library; frontends consume it.
- No telemetry phone-home, ever. Observability is opt-in and self-hosted.

## Current State

**Version:** 1.3.0 — Advanced Reasoning 🧠  
**Stats:** 25 source modules, ~20,000 LOC, 7 LLM providers (+ generic `openai-compatible`), 5 built-in tools (+web_search, +browser), **554 unit tests**, 119 verification tests across 13 modules (+vllm, +llamacpp, +mcp), **multi-modal input support**, **browser automation tool** (10 CDP actions), **graceful degradation under load**, **self-healing engine**, **advanced reasoning** (tree-of-thought, self-reflection), multi-arch CI with signed images + SBOM, official Helm chart, WASM plugin system, SQLite conversation persistence, durable execution, multi-agent patterns.
**Production verified:** 3,597 HTTP requests, 0 errors, 0 restarts, 10 Mi RSS under load, 7.5h uptime on rpi5 K3s (v0.9.11 audit).

**rpi5 Deployment Verdict (v0.9.11):** All 13 resolved issues from feedback confirmed working. 10 critical bugs fixed. 4 documentation gaps closed. 4 feature requests documented for future versions. **All production hardening items completed.** RavenClaws runs successfully on Raspberry Pi 5 (aarch64, 8GB RAM, K3s) with ~3 MiB RSS idle memory, ~1m CPU idle, <1s startup, and ~50 MB container image — **265x less memory and 228x less CPU than OpenClaw**. **v1.0.1 closes the final 4 critical rpi5 issues: `/tools/{name}` 404, RavenFabric URL builder, `/execute` empty result, and distroless SIGHUP — all resolved.**

**v0.9.11 Comprehensive Performance Audit (2026-06-29, 7.5h test session):**
- **3,597** HTTP requests served, **0 errors**, **0 restarts** — production-stable
- **10 Mi RSS** after heavy testing (only +2 Mi from idle of 8 Mi) — no memory leak
- **All 8 HTTP endpoints** verified — `/health` in 3ms, `/chat` in 899ms, `/ready` in 1,259ms
- **All 5 CLI modes** verified — single (1.69s), supervisor (1.10s), swarm (3.05s), orchestrate (~2.5s), eval (~0.5s)
- **`/ready` now waits for LLM connectivity check** (1.26s) — improvement from v0.9.9
- **`--no-final-required` is essential** — without it, agent loop never completes with `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud`
- **Token tracking shows 0** — metrics gap, counter not wired to LLM responses
- **Tool calls counter stuck at 0** — needs verification with tool-invoking prompt
- **Distroless container trade-offs confirmed:** no `npx` (MCP clients fail), no `curl`/`wget` (HTTP testing requires port-forward), no `kill` (SIGHUP config reload requires procfs mount)
- **Overall verdict:** Production-ready — deploy without hesitation. Memory stability and zero errors make this suitable for 24/7 operation.

**Strategic focus (v0.9.14):** ✅ **All completed.** Token tracking, tool call counting, `/ready` caching, MCP server `params` optionality, RavenFabric pipe policy, empty eval config validation, and `imagePullPolicy` verification — all metrics and polish gaps from the v0.9.11 rpi5 audit are now closed.

**Strategic focus (v0.9.15):** ✅ **All completed.** vLLM docs + verification tests, llama.cpp docs + verification tests, distroless HTTP testing docs, website docs pages for both providers — all ecosystem expansion gaps from the v0.9.11 rpi5 audit are now closed.

**Strategic focus (v0.9.16):** ✅ **All completed.** `--mcp-sse-server` CLI flag wired, SSE transport for MCP client config, MCP integration tests (stdio + SSE), SSE transport documentation — the last v1.0 blocker is closed. **All v1.0 exit criteria are met. v1.0 is next — the stable release.**

### ✅ v0.4.0 Released (2026-06-03)

All v0.4 blockers resolved and shipped:
- ✅ Security features wired to agent loop (commit `51e42b0`)
- ✅ Structured function calling (OpenAI Tools format)
- ✅ 274 unit tests + 94 verification tests
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline green (fmt, clippy, test, security scans)

**Known limitations (documented, not blockers):**
- k8s Deployment enters CrashLoopBackOff — server mode planned for v0.7
- SSE transport for MCP not yet implemented (stdio only in v0.5.2)
- Multi-modal input (images) — Anthropic client has stub, not wired to CLI

### 🔧 Critical Blockers (v0.5 Release)

1. ~~**Code duplication across OpenAI-compatible clients**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.0 — unified `OpenAICompatibleClient`
2. ~~**No provider fallback/retry logic**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.1 — exponential backoff, circuit breaker
3. ~~**No token budget tracking**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.1 — `TokenBudget` struct with cost estimation
4. ~~**No MCP integration**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.2 — full MCP client with stdio transport
5. ~~**No native Anthropic provider**~~ ✅ Fixed v0.5.3 — direct Claude API with tool use

### ✅ Resolved (v0.1 → v0.5.3)

1. ~~**`Cargo.lock` is git-ignored, but `--locked` is used in CI**~~ ✅ Fixed — lockfile committed
2. ~~**Dockerfile cross-compile fails (no cross-linker)**~~ ✅ Fixed — `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` + linker config
3. ~~**RavenFabric agent download unverified**~~ ✅ Fixed — SHA256SUMS verification

## Competitive Positioning

RavenClaws aims to be the **preferred alternative** to the current field — including
**OpenClaw**, **NanoClaw**, **ZeroClaw**, **OpenFang**, **nanobot**, **ironclaw**,
**Claude Cowork**, Cognition (Claude), Manus, Perplexity Comet, Kimi, Open Interpreter,
and Vellum. Not by out-featuring them, but by being **fully functional as a primary
agent** while also being smaller, more secure, and more efficient.

We don't win by out-featuring them. We win by refusing to compromise on all five
pillars at once. By category:

- **vs. OpenClaw** (the primary comparison from rpi5 testing): RavenClaws is **265x more memory-efficient** (~3 MiB RSS vs ~800 MiB), **228x less CPU at idle** (~1m vs ~228m), starts in **<1s vs ~5-10s**, has a **15.8 MB vs ~500 MB container image** (20-48x smaller), and is **distroless/non-root vs full Node.js runtime running as root**. OpenClaw wins on API surface (full REST API vs 3 endpoints), agent loop usability (no `FINAL:` requirement), tool ecosystem (Playwright, PostgreSQL, ChromaDB, SearXNG via MCP), and MCP server support (SSE vs stdio-only in v0.9.3). By v0.9.9, RavenClaws will match OpenClaw's primary agent capabilities (tool execution, MCP ecosystem, HTTP API) while maintaining this efficiency advantage.
- **vs. cloud / hosted assistants** (Claude Cowork, Manus, Perplexity Computer, Kimi): RavenClaws is **self-hostable, offline-capable, and source-available** under AGPLv3. Your data and tool calls never leave infrastructure you control — no phone-home.
- **vs. minimal agent runtimes** (Open Interpreter, ZeroClaw, PicoClaw): RavenClaws matches their footprint while adding a real **security model** (deny-by-default tool policy, audit log, sandboxing) and **multi-provider** routing with fallback.
- **vs. SDK / platform plays** (Vellum, Hermes Agent): RavenClaws is a **single dependency-light binary**, not a service you rent or a framework you marry. Embed it, ship it, forget it.

The bar: anything the field can do, RavenClaws should do **smaller, safer, and
simpler** — or deliberately not at all.

> **Where RavenClaws must lead, measurably (v1.0):** memory-safe core with zero
> known CVEs, sub-15 MB binary, sub-50 ms cold start, fully self-hostable and
> air-gappable, signed + SBOM-attested supply chain. These are claims we will
> benchmark and publish — not marketing.

2. **Edge-deployable** — ~5 MB binary, ~3 MiB RSS idle / ~10 MiB RSS under load, ~1m CPU idle, runs on Raspberry Pi, air-gapped capable
3. **RavenFabric mesh** — E2E-encrypted remote execution across fleet (unique)
4. **Autonomous heartbeat** — operates independently for days/weeks, no supervision required ✅ v0.9
5. **Self-orchestrating swarm** — dynamically provisions and manages 10s–1000s of workers in any topology, each with unique capability profiles. No fixed limit — the swarm scales to the task.
6. **265x more memory-efficient than OpenClaw** — ~3 MiB RSS vs ~800 MiB, **228x less CPU** (~1m vs ~228m), <1s startup vs ~5-10s, 15.8 MB image vs ~500 MB (20-48x smaller). Runs on an $80 Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB RAM where OpenClaw needs a server.
7. **Production-proven stability** — 3,597 HTTP requests, 0 errors, 0 restarts, only +2 MiB memory growth over 7.5 hours of heavy testing on rpi5 K3s. Verified by comprehensive performance audit (v0.9.11).

## Features Required to Become the Preferred Alternative

Being *preferred* is a two-step bar: first reach **parity** on the capabilities the
field now treats as table stakes, then **win decisively** on the five pillars where
the cloud incumbents structurally can't follow.

### Part 1 — Table stakes (reach parity)

| Capability | Why it's table stakes | In RavenClaws | Target |

| Connectors / integrations (OAuth) | Claude-style connectors; Manus's weakness | ❌ | v0.10 |

### Part 2 — Where RavenClaws wins (the "preferred" wedge)

| Differentiator | Why it beats the field | Pillars | Phase |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|
| **Local-first / self-hosted / air-gapped** | Manus is cloud-only; Comet's "Local" is a browser, not a worker. RavenClaws runs fully offline with Ollama. | Secure · Simple | ✅ core |
| **Security model: deny-by-default + sandbox + audit** | Field bolts security on; we ship it in core. | Secure | ✅ v0.4 (wired) |
| **~5 MB single binary, edge/embeddable** | No cloud agent runs on a Raspberry Pi. OpenClaw is ~500 MB Node.js. | Small · Efficient | ✅ |
| **~3 MiB RSS memory** | 265x less memory than OpenClaw (~800 MiB). Runs on a $80 Raspberry Pi 5. | Efficient | ✅ |
| **<1s startup** | OpenClaw takes ~30s to start. RavenClaws is ready instantly. | Efficient | ✅ |
| **Provider-agnostic + cost-aware routing** | Not locked to one model vendor. Generic `openai-compatible` unlocks 10+ backends. | Efficient · Robust | v0.5 → v1.0 |
| **RavenFabric mesh: E2E-encrypted remote exec** | Unique — competitors are single-host or single-cloud. | Robust | ✅ v0.6.1 |
| **No telemetry · signed + SBOM** | Trust as a feature, verifiable end-to-end. | Secure | ✅ |
| **Open core + commercial** | No lock-in, vs. proprietary cloud. | Simple | ✅ |

### Part 3 — The five that move the needle most

1. **`--exec` reliability (v0.9.4)** ✅ — Must produce output with ANY model. No silent failures. This was the #1 complaint from rpi5 testing — now resolved.
2. **Tool execution with any model (v0.9.5)** ✅ — Text-based fallback for models that don't emit structured `tool_calls`. Tool execution logging. Configured web search endpoint. ToolRegistry wired into agent loop.
3. **HTTP agent API (v0.9.6)** ✅ — `/chat`, `/execute`, `/tools` endpoints so the server can actually run agents. MCP TOML config, multi-MCP-client, config hot-reload, deep health check.
4. **MCP ecosystem integration (v0.9.7)** ✅ — Multi-MCP-client, readiness LLM check, SSE transport for both client and server.
5. **Production hardening (v0.9.8)** ✅ — All 5 infrastructure components wired. Configurable sandbox. OTEL warning suppression. LiteLLM API key docs.

**v0.9.10 — The five that move the needle:** ✅ All completed
1. **Community health files** ✅ — `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, `FUNDING.yml`, issue templates (bug report, feature request, config), PR template.
2. **Graceful shutdown for heartbeat** ✅ — `Drop` impl on `HeartbeatAgent` that calls `persist_state()`. State is now saved on graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT) without requiring a signal handler.
3. **Init container `chown` to K8s deployment** ✅ — `initContainers` section with `busybox:1.36.1` running `chown -R 65532:65532 /workspace` as root before the main container starts.
4. **`--exec` mode documentation** ✅ — Documented that `--exec` mode requires `FINAL:` format or `--no-final-required` flag. Added examples for both cases. Updated `docs/guides/getting-started.md`.
5. **Migration docs v0.9.1→v0.9.2** ✅ — `AgentMessageBus`, `MessageType`, `SwarmHealthMonitor`, `WorkerHealthStatus` additions. Updated `docs/guides/migration.md`.

**v0.9.11 — The three that move the needle:** ✅ All completed
1. **Agent loop deduplication** ✅ — Extracted shared `run_agent_loop_inner()` function containing all iteration logic (~400 lines). Both `run_agent_loop_with_registry` and `run_agent_loop_with_mcp_and_registry` now delegate to it, eliminating near-identical code duplication. ~350 lines saved. (#dedup)
2. **Azure OpenAI adapter** ✅ — New `Azure` variant in both `LLMProvider` (config.rs) and `OpenAICompatibleProvider` (llm.rs). Uses `api-key` header instead of `Bearer`, adds `api-version=2024-02-15-preview` query parameter. Mapped in CLI (`--provider azure`), factory (`create_client`), and multi-model routing. (#azure-adapter)
3. **Eval harness integrated with agent loop** ✅ — `EvalRunner::run_task()` now uses `run_agent_loop()` instead of a single direct LLM call. Eval tasks exercise the full ReAct loop with tool use, security checks, and iteration limits. (#eval-integration)

**v0.9.12 — The one that moves the needle most:** ✅ Completed
1. **Durable execution (checkpoint/resume)** ✅ — Agent loop now saves iteration-level checkpoints to disk as atomic JSON files. On restart, the loop resumes from the last checkpoint instead of starting fresh. `CheckpointState` captures full iteration context (messages, iteration count, provider/model metadata). Checkpoints are deleted on all exit paths (success, error, max iterations). Wired into background task manager for seamless resume across process restarts. (#durable-execution)

**v0.9.13 — The one that moves the needle most:** ✅ Completed
1. **Multi-agent patterns as primitives** ✅ — Debate, review-loop, research-synthesize, voting. ✅ **v0.9.13**

**v0.9.14 — The five that move the needle next:** ✅ All completed
1. **Token tracking wired to LLM responses** ✅ — Parse `usage` field from LLM responses and accumulate in `/metrics`. Currently shows 0 tokens across all requests. *(#token-tracking)*
2. **Tool calls counter wired** ✅ — Increment tool call counter on each tool execution in agent loop. Currently shows 0 tool calls in `/metrics`. *(#tool-call-counter)*
3. **`/ready` optimized with caching** ✅ — Cache LLM connectivity check result with configurable TTL (default 30s) to avoid 1.26s latency on every probe. *(#ready-caching)*
4. **MCP server JSON-RPC `params` made optional** — accept requests without `params` field. *(#mcp-params-optional)*
5. **Add pipe detection to RavenFabric policy engine** — Allow `sh -c "cmd | cmd2"` by detecting pipe characters in command strings. *(#ravenfabric-pipe-policy)*
6. **Fix `--eval /dev/null` empty input handling** — Produce meaningful output when given empty input. *(#eval-empty-input)*
7. **Set `imagePullPolicy: Always` for `:latest` tag** — Update K8s manifest to pull `:latest` on every restart. *(#image-pull-policy)*

**Exit criteria:** ✅ ALL MET
- [x] `/metrics` shows accurate token counts and tool call counts
- [x] `/ready` responds in < 100ms (cached LLM check)
- [x] MCP server accepts requests without `params` field
- [x] RavenFabric policy allows `sh -c "cmd | cmd2"` patterns
- [x] `--eval /dev/null` produces meaningful output
- [x] K8s manifest uses `imagePullPolicy: Always` for `:latest` tag
- [x] All 478+ tests pass, clippy clean, no regressions

### ✅ v0.9.15 — Ecosystem Expansion 🎯 *(completed)*

**Theme:** Ship the deferred ecosystem expansion items — vLLM docs + verification tests,
llama.cpp docs + verification tests, distroless HTTP testing docs, and website docs
pages for both providers. Close all remaining documentation gaps from the v0.9.11
rpi5 audit.

#### Completed in v0.9.15

- [x] **Ship vLLM docs + verification tests** — Created `docs/guides/vllm.md` with quick start, configuration reference, tool-calling support table, troubleshooting table, and multi-model examples. Created `scripts/lib/test-provider-vllm.sh` with connectivity check and basic prompt test. *(#vllm-docs)*
- [x] **Ship llama.cpp docs + verification tests** — Created `docs/guides/llamacpp.md` with quick start, configuration reference, tool-calling support table, troubleshooting table, performance tips, and multi-model examples. Created `scripts/lib/test-provider-llamacpp.sh` with connectivity check and basic prompt test. *(#llamacpp-docs)*
- [x] **Document distroless HTTP testing method** — Added `kubectl port-forward` and `docker run` testing sections to `docs/guides/getting-started.md`. *(#distroless-testing-docs)*
- [x] **Create website docs pages for vLLM and llama.cpp** — Created `website/public/docs/vllm.html` and `website/public/docs/llamacpp.html` mirroring the markdown guides. Updated sidebar nav in all existing docs pages. Updated sitemap.xml. Updated docs overview page with new doc cards. *(#website-docs)*
- [x] **Update verify.sh MODULES array** — Added `vllm` and `llamacpp` entries to the MODULES array in `scripts/verify.sh`. *(#verify-modules)*

- [x] Distroless HTTP testing method documented in getting-started guide
- [x] Website docs pages for vLLM and llama.cpp created and linked from sidebar
- [x] verify.sh MODULES array includes vllm and llamacpp entries
- [x] All 478+ tests pass, clippy clean, no regressions

### ✅ v0.9.16 — SSE MCP Ecosystem Verification 🎯 *(completed)*

**Theme:** Wire the SSE MCP transport into the CLI and config, create integration tests,
and update documentation. This is the last remaining v1.0 blocker — once complete,
all v1.0 exit criteria are met.

#### Completed in v0.9.16

- [x] **Wire `--mcp-sse-server` CLI flag** — Added `--mcp-sse-server` (env: `RAVENCLAWS_MCP_SSE_SERVER`), `--mcp-sse-host` (default `0.0.0.0`), and `--mcp-sse-port` (default `8081`) flags to `main.rs`. Dispatch block creates `McpSseServer`, wires graceful shutdown via `ShutdownFlag`. *(#mcp-sse-wiring)*
- [x] **Wire SSE transport for MCP client config** — Added `url: String` field to `McpServerConfig`. `McpClientManager::from_config()` creates SSE transport when `url` is non-empty. Validation ensures only one of `command` or `url` is set. *(#mcp-sse-wiring)*
- [x] **Remove `#[allow(dead_code)]` from SSE components** — `McpTransportConfig::Sse` variant, `McpSseServer` struct and impl, and `McpClientManager::from_config()` SSE branch all unwired — now fully wired and active. *(#mcp-sse-wiring)*
- [x] **Update `lib.rs` re-exports** — `McpSseServer` added to public API re-exports. Module description updated to "JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio + SSE". *(#mcp-sse-wiring)*

- [x] **Update verify.sh MODULES array** — Added `mcp` entry to the MODULES array in `scripts/verify.sh`. *(#mcp-sse-tests)*
- [x] **Update SSE transport documentation** — Added SSE transport sections to `docs/guides/mcp-integration.md` covering: transport types comparison table, SSE client configuration, SSE server mode (`--mcp-sse-server`), SSE IDE integration (OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, VS Code), and SSE multi-agent workflows. *(#mcp-sse-docs)*
- [x] **Update website SSE transport docs** — Updated `website/public/docs/mcp-integration.html` with transport types table, SSE client config, SSE server endpoint table, IDE integration examples, and "New in v0.9.16" sidebar section. *(#mcp-sse-docs)*

**Exit criteria:** ✅ ALL MET
- [x] `--mcp-sse-server` CLI flag works with `--mcp-sse-host` and `--mcp-sse-port`
- [x] MCP client connects to SSE servers via `url` field in config
- [x] MCP integration tests pass (stdio + SSE)
- [x] verify.sh MODULES array includes mcp entry
- [x] SSE transport documented in both markdown guide and website HTML
- [x] All 478+ tests pass, clippy clean, no regressions

### ✅ v1.0 — Simply the Best 🏆 *(released 2026-07-02)*

### ✅ v1.4 — Universal Parity: The Merge Phase *(2026-08-13)*

**Theme:** Lift the four low-risk, high-value, non-duplicated components from the
sibling **RavenAssistant01** orchestrator into RavenClaws as idiomatic,
feature-gated, fully-tested modules. This closes the OpenClaw/Manus parity gaps
(long-term memory, conversation search, domain-level web policy, messaging) and
adds the missing "fleet" primitive (programmatic K8s pod lifecycle).

Per `RAVENCLAWS-MERGE.md`, the merge candidates were:

| # | Component | Verdict | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `K8sManager` → `src/k8s.rs` (feature `k8s`) | 🟢 MERGE | ✅ Done |
| 2 | `WebAccessPolicy` → `src/web_policy.rs` | 🟢 MERGE | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Long-term memory + search + auto-title → `persistence.rs` | 🟢 MERGE | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Messaging integrations → `src/integrations.rs` | 🟡 ADAPT | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Tool-aware `<tool_call>` parser | 🟠 SKIP (loop superior) | ✅ Skipped |
| 6 | Web dashboard SPA | 🟡 DEFER | ⏳ Deferred |
| 7 | Scheduled tasks (cron) | 🔴 SKIP (`scheduler.rs` exists) | ✅ Skipped |
| 8 | Cost tracking / learning feedback | 🟡 AUDIT later | ✅ Cost tracking done (2026-08-20) — `CostTracker`/`CostSummary`/`ModelPricing`; learning feedback deferred |

#### Completed in v1.4

- [x] **Domain-level web access policy** — `src/web_policy.rs` (`WebAccessPolicy`, `WebCategory`, `RateLimiter`, `extract_domain`). Category-based allow/block/permission rules wired into `web_fetch`/`web_search` and `ToolRegistry::with_config`. New `[web_policy]` config section (disabled by default). 11 tests.
- [x] **Long-term memory + conversation search + auto-title** — `persistence.rs` gains `MemoryStore`, `search_conversations()`, and auto-title with a `title` column. 16 tests.
- [x] **Kubernetes operator support** — `src/k8s.rs` (`K8sManager`, `K8sManagerConfig`) behind the optional `k8s` cargo feature. Parameterized labels/image/namespace/secret. 4 tests.
- [x] **Messaging & connector integrations** — `src/integrations.rs` (Slack, Discord, Teams, Signal, Matrix, Telegram, Email, SMS), env-var-gated with graceful `disabled` fallback. 10 tests.
- [x] **Stale Helm `appVersion` fixed** — `0.7.2` → `1.3.0`.
- [x] **K8s init-container non-root fix** — removed the root-running `chown-workspace` init container.

**Exit criteria:** ✅ ALL MET
- [x] `cargo test --locked` passes (587 tests, up from 547)
- [x] `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean (default + `--features k8s`)
- [x] `cargo fmt --check` clean
- [x] Default ~5 MB binary unaffected (`k8s` optional feature)
- [x] Each feature committed and pushed individually
- [x] ROADMAP.md deduplicated (removed ~2,048 lines of accidental checklist duplication)

## [Unreleased]

### 🔴 Critical — Fix Now (blocking)

- [x] **Fix `src/patterns.rs` compile error** ✅ **DONE (2026-08-14)** — removed
  a stray closing brace in `run_research_synthesize()` and normalized indentation.
  Crate compiles; 587+ tests pass.

### 🔴 Critical — Dependency Vulnerabilities (security)

- [x] **Upgrade `wasmtime` to a patched release** ✅ **DONE (2026-08-14)** —
  `wasmtime` 28.0.1 → 47.0.3, clearing all RUSTSEC advisories (incl. 2 CRITICAL
  sandbox escapes). Only 4 "unmaintained" transitive warnings remain (accepted risk).

### 🟡 Medium — Dependency Hygiene

- [x] **Triage unmaintained crates** ✅ **DONE (2026-08-14)** — `paste` removed
  via the wasmtime upgrade; `backoff`/`derivative`/`rustls-pemfile` are transitive
  deps of the optional `k8s` feature and `instant` of `notify`. Accepted as
  low-risk (unmaintained ≠ vulnerable); re-evaluate on future advisories.

### 🟡 Medium — Security Hardening

- [x] **K8s: hardcoded default secret** ✅ **DONE (2026-08-14)** — documented
  `changeme` as an explicit placeholder + out-of-band generation + rotation.
- [x] **K8s: TLS disabled** ✅ **DONE (2026-08-14)** — documented in-cluster HTTP
  rationale (TLS at mesh/ingress; `Config::validate()` enforces HTTPS externally).
- [x] **K8s: NetworkPolicy egress too broad** ✅ **DONE (2026-08-14)** — added a
  CIDR-scoping hardening example + rationale.
- [x] **RBAC least-privilege** ✅ **DONE (2026-08-14)** — scoped `secrets` access
  to `resourceNames: ["ravenclaws-secrets"]` (`get` only). Verified live via kubectl.
- [x] **HMAC audit key** ✅ **DONE (2026-08-14)** — confirmed key is `OsRng`-
  generated (not hardcoded) and zeroized; ephemeral per-process by design.
- [x] **`.unwrap()` on poisoned mutexes** ✅ **DONE (2026-08-14)** — 94 sites
  converted to `.lock().unwrap_or_else(|p| p.into_inner())`.
- [x] **`unsafe` in dependency** ✅ **DONE (2026-08-19)** — no first-party
  `unsafe` code exists; added `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` to both `lib.rs` and
  `main.rs` to enforce the memory-safety pillar at compile time. (`Cargo.lock`'s
  `security-framework` is a macOS transitive dep, not first-party code.)

### 🟢 Low — Platform & Polish

- [x] **Windows support** ✅ **DONE (2026-08-14)** — Windows MSVC targets added
  to CI; `main.rs` shutdown signals made cross-platform.
- [x] **`SECURITY.md` version table is stale** ✅ **DONE (2026-08-14)** — updated
  to 1.x.
- [x] **Container size regression risk** ✅ **TRIAGED (2026-08-19)** — binary is
  ~7.7 MB; driven by v1.x feature breadth (SQLite, OpenTelemetry, reqwest), not
  `wasmtime` (LTO eliminates unused plugin runtime). `plugins`/`k8s` remain
  feature-gated. Accepted tradeoff; re-evaluate dependency consolidation pre-2.0.
- [x] **Threat model / fuzzing** ✅ **DONE (2026-08-19/20)** — threat model +
  posture profiles published in `SECURITY.md`; deterministic fuzz-style test
  added (`test_policy_engine_never_panics_on_adversarial_input`, 10k inputs).
  Formal `cargo-fuzz`/libFuzzer harness remains future work.

## 🎯 NemoClaw Competitive Analysis (2026-08-14)

NVIDIA **NemoClaw** (22.1k★, TypeScript, ~198 contributors) is the strongest
technical competitor in the "secure agent runtime" category. It is a **reference
stack** that runs OpenClaw / Hermes / LangChain Deep Agents inside NVIDIA
OpenShell sandboxes. Its headline capabilities are:

| NemoClaw capability | What it actually is |
|---|---|
| **Managed inference + model router** | Routes each request to a model by **task complexity** (not round-robin), with GPU/local inference paths (Podman GPU, DGX Spark, llama.cpp, Ollama) |
| **Network policy + operator approval flow** | Egress control with **human-in-the-loop approval**, static + dynamic presets |
| **Sandbox snapshots** | Capture/rollback of sandbox filesystem state |
| **Blueprint lifecycle** | Declarative, reusable agent blueprints |
| **Guided onboarding / installer** | Interactive express-install, platform presets |
| **Managed integrations** | Curated connector onboarding |
| **Security posture profiles** | Formal controls reference, risk framework, posture profiles, internal security reviews |
| **Supervisor gateway** | Supervisor with gateway recovery + portable authority |
| **CUA (computer use)** | Gated computer-use-agent readiness |

### Where RavenClaws already wins

- **Footprint:** ~5 MB single Rust binary vs a TypeScript+Python+Shell multi-stack
  that requires Node.js + (optionally) a GPU.
- **Durable execution:** checkpoint/resume is unique; NemoClaw snapshots but does
  not checkpoint the *agent loop*.
- **Multi-agent patterns** (debate/review/research/voting) ship as primitives.
- **Self-hosted + air-gappable + no telemetry** — no NVIDIA/OpenShell dependency.

### 🎯 Where RavenClaws must catch up (new roadmap items)

1. ✅ **Complexity-based model routing** — DONE (2026-08-14) — `route_by_complexity()`
   heuristic in `src/llm.rs`.
2. ✅ **Human-in-the-loop approval flow** — DONE (2026-08-20) — tool-call HITL (v0.8)
   + network-egress operator approval (`Decision::RequireApproval`).
3. ✅ **Sandbox filesystem snapshots** — DONE (2026-08-20) — `Sandbox::snapshot()/restore()`.
4. ✅ **Declarative agent blueprints** — DONE (2026-08-19) — `src/blueprint.rs` +
   `--blueprint` CLI flag.
5. ✅ **Interactive installer** — DONE (2026-08-20) — `install.sh` with dev/prod/airgap
   presets + verification module.
6. ✅ **Security posture profiles** — DONE (2026-08-19) — threat model + dev/prod/airgap
   profiles in `SECURITY.md`.
7. 🟡 **GPU/local inference management** — PARTIAL (2026-08-20) — `LocalInference`
   discovery probes Ollama/llama.cpp/vLLM endpoints; full provisioning (model
   warmup, GPU scheduling) deferred.
8. 🟡 **Computer-use agent (CUA)** — PARTIAL (2026-08-20) — `BrowserTool::check_availability()`
   gated readiness probe added; full screenshot → plan → act vision loop deferred
   (needs real WebSocket CDP + vision LLM).

### 🟢 Strategic note

NemoClaw is a *stack that hosts other agents*; RavenClaws is *the agent itself*.
The wedge is not to copy NemoClaw's hosting model but to ship its **security
controls** (approval flows, snapshots, posture profiles) as first-class, in-core
features — in a 5 MB binary that needs no NVIDIA hardware. Every item above is a
"better, smaller, self-hosted" implementation of a NemoClaw strength.
